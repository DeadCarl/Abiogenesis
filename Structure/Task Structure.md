# Task levels
In a lot of post-_[World of Warcraft](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft")_ MMOs (and games inspired by it), most sidequests fall into the Big Five templates: [Kill Quests](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassMonsterSlaughterSidequest"),note  [Fetch Quests](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest"),note  FedEx Quests,note  [Collect Quests](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest"),note  and [Escort Quests](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission").note  As [discussed![](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otAkP5VjIv8) by _[Extra Credits](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits")_, the prevalence of the Big Five is often a result of the common view among game designers that the only purpose of sidequests is to [justify](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope") in-story the endless [combat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGsEqualCombat "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGsEqualCombat") [grind](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding") gameplay.
# Ventures, journeys, projects ("Adventure, mission")
Tales are the main story of Wyrd Street. They form an ongoing narrative, and are built around the main Iconic characters (Na Wen, Ji Wensdottir, and Lo Carlsson).

Ventures are risky and require considerable investment: therefore, there should be a good reason why characters should sign on for it

Investment in this case is not just material, but pathological as well; the characters *need* an emotional connection to most ventures for it to have impact, otherwise it's a lot of work for something irrelevant to the party. At best, you get a mercenary attitude. At worst, the players are bored.

Ventures are big and diffused, rely more on long term reward than instant gratification.
# common Detours ("sidequests")
Jobs are lesser tasks undertaken in between Tales. They are concentrated, intended to be completed in at most one or two sessions and provide lesser rewards.

However, the benefit of sidequests is that they take less effort, adjust the narrative tension of the overall arc, support wider worldbuilding, and give the GM time to plan the tougher to design quests.

Low risk, low investment, but faster gratification.

each section of the story changes emphasis btwn the four following behaviors

explore - introduction
expand - expansion - knowledge
exploit - progression - understanding - interaction
exterminate - finale - test 

orient
observe
decide
act

if a quest design feels like a chore, try to figure why you feel that way - all quests are a chore in the end, but become more meaningful when used right
