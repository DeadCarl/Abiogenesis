## Story Quality
The setting of Abiogenesis supports a wide variety of complications and challenges. While this offers a rich storytelling experience, using every rule risks bogging the game down in mechanics that are only sometimes necessary.

To balance the demands of good pacing and rich storytelling, we introduce the tool known as the Story Quality. These are adaptable modifications to the core game rules that add or alter game aspects, some subtlely, others radically. These qualities can be functionally added or removed at any time 

The GM may add or remove these story qualities at any point of the story to balance speed and detail.
## Stages

## Mysteries
One of the important motifs of Abiogenesis is mystery: players are supposed to be left in the dark, the lore is supposed to not answer all questions. However, sometimes the GM must make lore judgements in order to resolve decisions in play. To support this, Abiogenesis introduces a tool called the Mystery. Similar to Story qualities, Mysteries are additions or modifying statements to the lore of the game which are only canonical to that particular campaign. GMs are obliged to create their own Mysteries for the Abiogenesis Universe as needed.

Additionally Mysteries can serve as setting modifiers that confirm or deny whether traditional cryptids, folklore, or the like are in the game, or which universe the setting is in. For example, one Mystery could be that the campaign is set in the X-Files or Stargate Universe.

### Stage I

### Stage II - Supply Dice
one method for supply expenditure would be to have the units of supply be containers of several characteristics, such as weight, object class, and the exhaustion value. Whenever a character needs a replacement, they roll a die against the exhaustion number (under succeeds). Supply dice are only spent on a failure. Failures always happen on a 20.

the base weight of a supply die should be 1 unit to an exhaustion number of 1. Therefore a full weight object will weigh 19 units worth. Dice expenditures do not lower the exhaustion number.
