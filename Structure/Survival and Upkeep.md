# Doc 1
# Living and upkeep or no upkeep?

## Background
Abiogenesis is a setting set in the space between regular life and the wild unknown continuously interrupting it. Due to the intimate nature of the setting, Abiogenesis focuses on character's efforts to fend for themselves or get ahead in a World recovering from an averted apocalypse.

To bring this tension to life, we use the living expenses mechanic. 
## Mechanics
### Savings
Money put in a financial institution grows by 10% interest per starting period. 
### Living Expenses
Living expenses are the costs needed to maintain a character's standard of living. These expenses are determined by the following character factors:
 - property
 - transportation
 - friends, partners and family
 - food and supplies; commodities
 - regular employees
 - Quality of life

Living expenses are combined and paid periodically - the period being set by the GM according to the intended character of the campaign. 

These expenses are summed on the (inventory, property, assets) group expenses sheet and must be paid in full at the beginning of each period.
## Candidate 2
Upkeep is a set amount per day, multiplied by the length of the period.

The amount selected should be considered on many factors, but you need to treat the value as a difficulty modifier and a gatekeeper: if the upkeep is too high, tougher stories will be harder to solve while cooler gear will be far less available.

The default value is $150 a day for all expenses for one person in 1 household. This number is based on the following [source](https://www.sunmark.org/connect/sunmark-360/heres-how-much-average-american-spends-day-how-do-you-measure) which represents hard mode.

Each additional character under one roof counts as an additional head in the household.
### Debt
Failing to pay for monthly upkeep results in the characters taking on debt. Debt's increases by a 10% interest every period, or by taking a bailout package determined by the GM to cancel the debt.

The GM has the right to refuse creating a bailout package.

Characters in debt cannot purchase anything with saved money: they can only use money found during the period until the debt is paid.
### Example penalties
Failing to pay upkeep can result in
- their house utilities being shut off, resulting in a loss of healing factor
- characters are kicked out of their rented property by the landlord
- losing the benefits of a family member, partner, or employee results until upkeep is paid again.
- The character has to pay out of pocket for consumables.
- increased gear malfunctions. When using narrative malfunction rules, this comes to GM discretion.
- Bad Luck
- vehicles start with zero fuel for that period. All gas must be found, made, or bought out of pocket for the duration of that period.
- Characters have gear up to the value of the debt withheld (pawned, repossessed, etc) until the next period.

## Periods
Modern campaigns, particularly those with survival mechanics, place a premium on bookkeeping logistics. 

At the campaign arc scale, we need to divide the campaign up into accounting periods. Traditionally, this was done by counting the standardized passage of time, but in practice this form of bookkeeping didn't fit every campaign neatly.

To solve this, Abiogenesis describes two methods of accounting for time frames and lets the GM decide which one is more beneficial to the GM. These are Chronological and Kairological turns.

The core difference between Chronological and Kairological time is that Chronology is the measurement of a passage of time, while Kairos is measuring time by the qualitative beat of recent events.

Chronological time is suited to accurate accounting and subtle changes because of its deliberate nature, but is the bugaboo of many tabletop efforts at bookkeeping because it doesn't match up with how the story develops, or requires bookkeeping during unwanted time. Even the standard passage of time requires bookkeeping to handle all the important events.

Chronological time is also ill suited for storytelling because they don't fit into the [pacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_(narrative)) requirements of modern story to maximize impact; It is better suited for maintaining narrative authenticity.

Kairological time, on the other hand, can be perfectly matched to the pace of the campaign's story without any adjustments: we simply set the period to the rhythm of the story. Kairological time is better at maintaining impact, but at the cost of authenticity.

If we're using both, we must be able to convert kairological time to chronological time.
### Chronological

Per day (24 hrs)
per week (7 days)
per month (30 days)

# Candidate: SOP
- Every 3 Days...
	- Roll for Weather
- Road Trips have random encounters
	- short trips have 1 dice
	- medium trips have 2 dice
	- long trips have 3 dice
### Kairo
Kairological time can also be defined by the player's time, or by the story arc's time.
#### Player Kairos
per session
per story beat/per scenario
#### [[_Default Campaign design#The language of adventure|Story Kairos]]
- Scenario (1-2 weeks) \[Recommended for upkeep]
- Beat (1-5 minute)
- Scene (1-4 hours)

# Doc 2
# Basic Logistics
In Abiogenesis, characters may be in several conditions:
## Condition 1: Unsupplied
Players without access to human infrastructure are reliant on their own supplies to meet all their needs. 

The [[Hazards#Sustenance hazard|sustenance hazard]] rules should be used along with the most bookkeeping.
## Condition 2: Undersupplied
Players with limited access to existing, abandoned or scarce human infrastructure can sometimes rely on scrounging, resulting in a feast or famine scenario.

Fatigue and [[Hazards#Sustenance hazard|sustenance hazard]] should be ready for use, but GMs should suspend the use the [[Hazards#Sustenance hazard|sustenance hazard]] during times of feast and reinstate it during famine. 

Use the Looting and Survival qualities. [[SOP & Bookkeeping|Bookkeeping]] with longer periods is also recommended.
## Condition 3: Supplied
Characters that can access human infrastructure within 2-4 hours are in areas can breathe easy. 

Suspend the [[Hazards#Sustenance hazard|sustenance hazard]] entirely, switch to the [[Hazards#Lifestyle Hazard|lifestyle hazard]], and suspend the [[Hazards#Fatigue Hazard|fatigue hazard]] whenever possible.
## Alternative: Opt-out

The GM can just add a patron to a one-shot adventure who outfits the party with “enough food and water and basic supplies to cover the journey.” So, this is easy to opt out of if the stuff undermines the party's enjoyment.
# Sustenance
## Candidate 1: Cheatsheets, standardized units & properties
- 1 unit of generic food
	- contains 1 day of food
	- consists of 2,000 calories
	- weighs 2.5 kg
	- Costs $20

- 1 Gallon of ground fuel of type x
	- 1 gallon is ~4(3.78541) liters
	- 1$ per liter in Abiogenesis

- Generic trip lengths
Distances traveled or worked assume an 8 hour work day. Overtime results in fatigue
	- short      - 16.0934 km (10 mi) ~ 15
		- represents a work commute or a short errand
	- medium - 193.121km (120 mi) ~ 195 (x13)
	- long       - 321.869 km (200 mi) ~ 320
	- all day    - 643.738km (400 mi) ~ 645 (x43)

- Travel pace based on road surface
	- Unimproved trail - Distance travelled is 1/4th current speed
	 - country road - distance travelled is 1/2 current speed (old shit: + sleeping in a closed top car (full body extension???)
	 - minor arterial highway, collectors and streets - distance travellled 1/2x speed
		 - includes gas and rest stop
	 - arterial Highway - distance travelled 1x speed
		 - includes restaurant + rest stop

Note: Effects such as group size or lack of amenities can provide additional speed penalties by overstretching the available resources or impacting readiness
