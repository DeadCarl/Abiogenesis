# Landmark Structured Maps
maps take labor, organization to look good
many map generators require the artist to organize it

target users
What if?
	we design the map around the major landmarks (nodal design)
Advantages
	fast, offloads work, blocks out the major parts of the map first AND fills inbtwn quickly

Creating maps is a labor intensive job
	lots of rules (geography, hydrography)
	mental map doesn't join with 

Most map generators either
	form totally random content
	or structureless (paint)

Target users
	worldbuilders
	game artists
	level designers
	

What if
	Mappers wanted to place the important points quickly
	ignore the inbetween for smtg else to handle

Nodal design
	So what we can build is a list of nodes with xy coordinates
	assign nodes importat information (there are 3 towns, a shipwreck is here, there is a resort)
	Set boundaries and RNG behavior (limits of where things are allowed to be)
	The software links it all together with the less important detail

Advantages
	Lightweight
		List of nodes
		Hash
		Settings
	Cooperatively organized
	Fine-tuning first
