# Laws

- [ ] What prohibitions are there on civilians entering the Danger Dorito without permission?
- [ ] It's illegal to be inside all zones without any official approval (you have to be inside a fishy organization with approval)
- [ ] Most approvals allow you to go to yellow or "green" zones, "Red Zones" are usually prohibited
- [ ] "'Black zones' do not exist"
- [ ] Usually for neighborhood watches on the edge there's a buffer zone (you shouldn't be in there for too long but there's no legal restriction)
- [ ] The rules are often poorly enforced due to a lack of personel
