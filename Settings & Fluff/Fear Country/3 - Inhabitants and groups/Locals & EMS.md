Escalating threats to the life and property have encouraged the growth of neighborhood watch programs into self-defense organizations. These voluntary organizations are unpredictable due to the lack of strong regulation, a lack of standardization, and so may take almost any form, law-abiding or otherwise.

Community patrols may be independent, endorsed by an organization such as a Church, tribe, or Law Enforcement agency, or are grown from prior arrangements such as a police volunteer program.
