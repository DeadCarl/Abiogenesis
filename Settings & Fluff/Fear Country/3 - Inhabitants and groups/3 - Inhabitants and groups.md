how do we authentically introduce Chinese or Russian State forces with heavy equipment like tanks in CONUS without starting WWIII?
OK, in or near Klamath Chinese or Russian tanks won't be spotted (actually North Koreans are more common as they are cheaper) (Russians after losing war is a former superpower for hire, they are allegedly the first "network state")

Typically saying there are PMCs and PSCs with very questionable allegiances around, they usually don't have heavy weapons but there are a few with big things. (a way they get weapon is through proxy, they will try to bribe their way
through a local national guard unit, then they will "donate" the equipment to the unit, then the unit will hand over the equipment to the groups.

## By region
- Klamath county
