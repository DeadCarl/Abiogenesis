We discussed how objectives in storytelling can be categorized into immediate, medium, and long-term goals. Reference to Stanislavski’s method for integrating objectives into a story.
# Throughline
# Superobjective
the driving reason for what a character does, the ultimate purpose of their actions for a given story arc.

for writing adventures, the superobjective can either be a particular character's superobjective, or the adventure's theme itself, the reason for writing it. if the gm picks the latter, be sure to devote some time to the characters super objective as well so the two mesh

# Objective
> The word objective is Elizabeth Reynolds Hapgood’s translation in An Actor Prepares of a number of ideas surrounding the Russian word, zadacha. This is translated by others as a problem, which arises in the imaginary circumstances, or a task, ‘which demands fulfilment through action’ (Stanislavsky in Focus: 87).

Inhuman characters, such as the environment or unconventional alien creatures may have a superobjective informed by the story's ruling idea, its throughline, or the creatures nature. Alternatively, anthropomorphizing the character is also a solution.

There may be other solutions.
