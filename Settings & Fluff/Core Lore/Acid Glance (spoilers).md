### chatlogs summary:

- **Development Process:**
  - **Objective Framework**: we discussed how objectives in storytelling can be categorized into immediate, medium, and long-term goals. Reference to Stanislavskiâ€™s method for integrating objectives into a story.
  - **Superobjective**: the ruling, long term goal or reason for the tasks a character does - aka a character's strategy to their tactics.
	  - The central aim is to understand and stop Erlkonig
  - **a experimental Process**: we Considered narrowing our focus by defining what should not be included in our story (e.g., avoiding highly intellectual elements, California as a setting).
	  - Decided against a California setting due to its post-apocalyptic nature (e.g., infrastructure collapse).

- **Narrative Ideas:**
  - **Timeline**: Set a few years post-immediate crisis; exploring the aftermath
	  - a team working to contain any instances of Erlkonig might not be something that's set up until after the immediate clusterfuck is over. It's not necessarily something that would be set up until a beachhead is established, I imagine
	  - set at the point where a team is devised for the point would be the first time where information about erlkonig would go outside of a SCIF room.
  - **Incident**: Idea of a detective inquiry into Erlkonig.
  - **Threat**: Contaminated devices, especially those affecting power infrastructure, such as a nuclear power plant.
  - **Plot Hook**: a commissioned investigation into a haunted, poorly maintained nuclear power plant with potential Erlkonig contamination
	  - the first ever search for Erlkonig story

- **Summary:**
  - **Superobjective**: Protect people by understanding Erlkonig.
  - **Objective**: Investigate and contain the contamination of a nuclear power plant.
  - **Story Pitch**: the cyber ghostbusters show up to make an inquiry about an old, poorly maintained nuclear power plant that is now haunted.
