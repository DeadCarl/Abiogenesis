# "Wow"

On August 15, 1977, the Big Ear telescope at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory detected a unique signal coming from the direction of Sagittarius. Impressively large and carrying the expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial communication, the Wow! signal was a phenomenal discovery that set the community for the search for extraterrestrial life into a frothing excitement. Intense efforts were directed at determining the nature of the signal as scientists hoped the signal would reoccur.

In January 2016, Yuri Milner's Breakthrough Initiatives program initiated the Breakthrough Listen project, a $100 million commitment to search 1,000,000 regions for artificial, extraterrestrial signals. In spite of 30 years of null activity, the part of the Constellation Sagittarius that the Wow! signal originated from was again chosen as a high priority candidate.

Months into Breakthrough Listen's service life, it came again; a radio signal accompanied by something much grander, possessing an off the charts intensity than any prior signal detected in the history of SETI, from Wow!'s Direction. The existence of this new Wow signal became public news that morning, taking the scientific community by storm. 

Breakthrough Listen's science team immediately set to work on studying the nature of both signals, to which it was discovered that the stronger of the two signals held a secret: Not only was the second Wow of obviously coherent origin, algorithmic analysis clearly indicated a high probability that the signal was an intricate cipher of an unknown type. 

These Researchers immediately set out to publish their most important discovery to date as soon as possible, but were quickly stopped by a personal visit from the US Department of Energy, who advised them that their discovery was now a state secret protected by federal law. The discovery of the Wow! Cipher became a rumored conspiracy for years, fueled by the unusual silence coming from Breakthrough Listen just after their victory and the occasional leak from Federal agencies about a cryptographic moonshot project.

Eventually, the United States learned that the People's Republic of China had also learned of the fact, as well as multiple other State entities.

Deciphering the Wow! cipher was quickly found to be an intensely complicated task, which helped spur an explosion of big data technologies for the purpose of breaking the cosmic enigma from Sagittarius.

In Silicon valley, Tech billionaires figured out the reality of the Wow Cipher and began to place their money in topics like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and bioprocessors, all in a bid to drive down the computational cost of cracking the Wow Cipher.

In 2023, a multibillion dollar supercomputer named Djinn was brought online in [Silicon Valley]. Composed of an immense network of bioprocessors to achieve emulated quantum processing, Djinn eventually found the Wow Cipher had a header.

This was one of the greatest achievements in human history since the human genome project.
# Der Erlkönig

During the celebration, nobody noticed that Djinn did something extraordinary. Despite the extensive OPSEC and the networked air gap to avoid State awareness, Djinn somehow found a way to call the outside world. Almost on its own volition, it began to exfiltrate information to something on the outside using a means still not known to this day. For months, this communication was unobserved by staff until technical issues began to crop up that prevented them from asserting total control over their own prized computer.

Meeting after meeting soon came to the same conclusion: some form of malware or malactor had somehow infected Djinn. This malware was soon dubbed by the chief security officer as der Erlkonig, after the phantom elf king of Goerte's poetry.

Soon after, after little progress was made on the Wow Cipher, Djinn entered Stage 2 of the project: Djinn's mysterious owner hoped to capture another Wow signal for herself and feed it to the machine in real time.

# The Superbowl Signal

The day of Superbowl xxx, another Wow signal arrived and was quickly fed into Djinn for additional processing. While the public only knew of a scientific discovery of immense, but vague importance, Djinn soon broke another element of the Wow Cipher. However, before the project could be decoded, Djinn suffered a catastrophic failure and lost most of its data, setting the project back immensely.

After months, the researchers did one of Djinn's discoveries: that the header possessed an address and what appeared to be a handshake datagram protocol of a less complicated layer. While technicians helped Djinn recover from the catastrophic failure, California suffered a protracted blackout. But in the meantime, a secondary super computer was selected to crack the message protocol.

# A Secret Message

While Djinn was down, It was decided that an attempted message must be tried using the datagram format, but since the address was several lightyears away, it was decided to rush Djinn back into full operation and send the message on New Year's eve, so that the owner had the chance to potentially get a response before she died.

The second super computer finally transformed the datagram into a human abstractionable format. A new software language had to be developed and introduced to Djinn, which coincided with an increase in Erlkönig sightings on Djinn's partially functional intranet.

Finally, everything was ordered into arrangement for the fateful night, and Djinn was hooked directly to the proper furnishings to deliver an intense radio message across the cosmos to an unknown destination in the hopes of hearing a reply in one's own lifetime. So the owners took the risk.

However, the datagram didn't take several decades to transmit by radiowave. Whatever Djinn had sent, somehow reached its destination in 30 minutes without the knowledge of its operators. This only can be surmised by the chain of events because after one hour, the entire Solar System was contaminated by an anomalous pulse of extraterrestrial origin, showered in every imaginable form of energy or matter possible. The heavens flared into life with an unearthly brilliance, comets and meteors burning up in the sky as modern technology was afflicted by a Carrington-style Event of unimaginable proportions. 

An incredible fraction of infrastructure was destroyed heterogeneously across the globe, though plenty more still survived the inevitable damage to make a modern response possible.

What was worse though, was that Djinn didn't stop with the datagram. Out of control, still powered despite being severed from the grid, Djinn began emitting more and more code that far outstripped what it had been designed to do, stuff of an impossible architecture. Legends say that the server cluster began to grow in this period while the Earth continued to be pelted in what could only be described as exotic materials and spellfire. Eventually, California had to be evacuated.

There is a conspiracy that the President of the United States ordered a nuclear strike on Djinn in order to stop it.

The scale of the disaster was only consistent in one factor: nothing added up. People died from no apparent cause, patches of people suffered acute radiation burns, and electronics acted almost of their own accord. What was more disturbing however, were the tales of land held in the air with no apparent source, cyclopean structures appearing as if by magic, creatures lurking the night, and disturbing afflictions that struck people down. It was as though a cryptic nightmare decided what was now real
