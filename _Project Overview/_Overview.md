# Pitch
v2
The game takes place in a near-future where the Earth has been seeded with anomalous materiel and phenomena which have transformed the landscape.

Abiogenesis takes deep inspiration from the STALKER and Half Life Series,  Campaigns consist of enduring the social instability the products of this catastrophe bring and exploring this new, darker wilderness for the strange, the uncanny, the cool, and the pants shitting terror that has scarred the country.

For the player, the game is "your work commute includes an AR-15 in the emergency kit." The cities still hum with life, but they are vulnerable to the new wilderness. Internal refugees, adventurers and bandits are rife.

Gameplay can be described as a tactical adventure - taking cues from the modern gunfight and the empty battlefield. firearms, cover, concealment, and tactics are important. Traditional monsters of fantasy are difficult to fit into this type of gameplay, as melee attacks need advantages to outweigh the high lethality of modern weapons.

## Why pick the Reflex System?

The Reflex system has the tools to fit the nature of a modern gunfight and survival.

# Definitions for success
For abio to be successful, we need to create a tabletop tactical adventure that can be described as stalker meets half life.

More precisely, we are creating a tabletop tactical adventure which takes the concepts of reality altering anomalous phenomena to intellectually immerse the player in the unnerving mysteries and dilemmas of a post disaster society. 

Additional goals:
- should test the feasibility of a tactical adventure
- should introduce the idea of the modern tactical adventure to non-k types
- use the reflex engine
- be interesting and fun for a modest population of tabletop enthusiasts
- contain lots of support to simplify play
- have original phenomena and behavior - this is *not* A setting for classic American paranormal tropes


- not expecting to make money
- not expecting a mainstream audience

---
Another definition for success would be to define the thematic tone through a concept delivered through text, visuals, and sound (like a title sequence).

Since there is no 'best' settled upon theme, we will instead refer to these as the in development examples, not final release
