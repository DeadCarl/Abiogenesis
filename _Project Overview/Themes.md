## Knowledge Gap
While the physical effects  of the de kuiper event was a baleful swan of tragedy, its repercussions have become far more disturbing for the future of human life on earth. In one brief instant of history, the gap between the human experience of the universe and understanding was torn apart in an unrecognizable mess of contradiction and the 'paranormal.''

The paranormal, defined as what science doesn't know, is now a common fact of life, swallowing so much of modern human existence in the darkness of scientific doubt. Wherever this spectre arises, the familiar is replaced by the alien, the safe rendered uncanny.
## Authentic, Hardened
When close to home, the world works similarly to our own and the stalkers get see a lot of its darker sides. Abuse, violence and physical injuries should be described just as horrifically as witnessing them in real life would be. Death and murder are serious things, just like in our world.

Even supernatural phenomena are studied from the viewpoint of natural science, not magic or religion. Even if the stalkers lack the scientific understanding of the researchers, their attitudes towards the phenomena and creatures of the Zone are usually very pragmatic.
### You Are Human
As weird as things get in the Zone, the player characters are still the protagonists with their actions and goals. The adventure may take them into the Zone but it is still a story about people, not the Zone. The causes and effects of their adventures are usually found on this side of the border.

## Threats and Disorder
Society exists perilously close to the border of darkness; outside its safety lie an threat to nations and peoples which cannot be underestimated. In extreme cases, failure is not optional.
### [insecurity](Motivation)
Characters are responsible for making their own living, so the sustenance should weigh heavy on player's minds. See [[#Survival gameplay]]

Normal job opportunities are limited. in return, there's plenty of high risk, high reward jobs.
## A nearly averted apocalypse
The fear of good sinking slowly into the dark

On the precipice of darkness and light; An oppressive, gothic environment is just outside the borders of society
## The State in Social Preservation mode
- [ ] rewrite required
Abiogenesis takes place in an setting of an averted apocalypse. All human society narrowly weathered an emergency of unimaginable scale at immense cost. Mammoth pools of resources and knowledge had to be redirected on the spot in response.

As of the moment, the government is saddled with the dual tasks of forming a National Recovery and an arrears of debts and losses it racked, in man, machine, and infrastructure. The end of federal social security, Rationing and conscription form the new normal as the Federal government pulls back from daily life to save for the unfulfilled National Recovery plans.

The landscape of post-de Kuiper America is littered with scrappy enterprises, liquidation startups, impoverished regulators and flimsy answers. It is a new age of the entrepreneur as many of economic champions or core pillars of the economy disappeared almost overnight.
