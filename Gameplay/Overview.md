# The language of adventure
With English, there is a progression of language elements:
```
 letters, words, sentences, paragraphs
```
For all storytelling we can actually create a similar progression:
```
story beat -> scene and sequel -> act -> Storyline
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_(drama)
```

For those more familiar with D&D, the traditional elements are ...
```
call and response -> encounter -> adventure -> campaign arc
```

For AB13, I find it's more to my liking if we describe the elements as
```
decision/rules -> incident -> scenario ->story arc
```
* note: an incident can be a encounter, odd-job event, or situation
* note: a scenario is a episode, big job, or tale
