Ranchhand wants to communicate with its own species

It needs a massive radio receiver to do this

??? Is that really a good idea? I think a regular humanoid birdie is interesting enough (can see them doing cargo cult shit to human technology)
("the cult of technology" has players fighting against ranchhands with guns and a stolen tank painted with religious symbols)

**(More elaboraton needed, what does it do?)**
white body

2 body plans smushed together
 * upper body is segmented - "post insectoid"
 * lower is more mamallian
one part hollow

### Formula to move something with wind

W = sqrt(195xlb/sqft)

109 kph is the speed that can pick a person off their feet, or lighter w/ a wider projected area

assuming the projected area of a supine person in the normal direction with the wind is a constant of .1 (smaller cross section), it would take about 202 kph to pick a person laying down off the ground

### Projected area formula
The projected area of a person may be assumed to be proportional to the DuBois area, and Penwarden has suggested an area ratio A/At), of 0.31 for a person standing facing the wind^[Measurements of Wind Drag on People Standing in a Wind Tunnel]


# Radix's Forager

Radix's forager is a vertebrate with an extremely high energy density.

it has a remarkably alien biology which requires charging with an exotic energy dense material, separate from its terrestrial diet

once it captures enough of this exotic material, the creature glows with an ionizing radiation, yet remains relatively unharmed.

The material is collectable

how it finds the material is unknown. Current speculation is that the migratory nature of these creatures is due to needing to find the material in the 4th dimension when it can only traverse on the 3rd.

Radix's forager has the ability to cook somebody with microwaves at an appreciable distance. See the [[Active Denial System]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System) from Raytheon.

It also has the ability to project a thunderbolt at the target to about 100 meters

the creature is relatively slow, relying on its projectile capabilities

**some factions might have special detectors for that thing** (probably private companies)

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:11 AM
wolves are out of my wheel house because again super rare in the US.

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:13 AM
* but coyotes?
* In California?
* fucking every where.

MausLast Tuesday at 4:21 AM
Well, tbf wolves are a meme themselves, one i confess to find cool.

That said, i have no idea how to mutate them, though the california area is going to be a partial nature reserve cuz of the danger dorito

MausLast Tuesday at 4:36 AM
* ... what about wolves with high intelligence?
* Lmao, 40 lungs

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:38 AM
Wolves with ultra-high animal intelligence seems a bit played out but you can try to sell me on it.

* that said, you could have wolves evolving some sort of social intelligence as well. Maybe like Ein From Cowboy Bebop, only neutral and on the periphery of society.

So they'd act kinda like crows would with humans.

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:45 AM
So effectively their boost from the mutations would be increased intelligence, both social and practical.

MausLast Tuesday at 4:45 AM
* basically.
* Clucas speculates that ignoring a human with an averted gaze is a learned adaptation to life in the big city. Indeed, many studies have shown that crows are able to learn safety behaviors from one another. For example, John Marzluff of the University of Washington (who co-authored the aforementioned paper with Clucas) used masked researchers to test the learning abilities of crows. He and his colleagues ventured into Seattle parks wearing one of two kinds of masks. The people wearing one kind of mask trapped birds; the others simply walked by.

* Five years later the scientists returned to the parks with their masks. The birds present at the original trapping remembered which masks corresponded to capturing—and they passed this information to their young and other crows. All the crows responded to the sight of a researcher wearing a trapping mask by immediately mobbing the individual and shrieking.
they'd need more than that imo, but it's a start

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:47 AM
yeah and I suppose not everything needs to neatly fit gamist expectations for narrative necessities.

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:47 AM
Ghost raccoons certainly don't.

MausLast Tuesday at 4:47 AM
* Though this is completely separate from the transponder melding bit
* that may just go to boars
* With the whole "I can incorporate anything into my body" concept

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:48 AM
yeah and wolves are already smart enough to get the tags off themselves.
just takes em time.

MausLast Tuesday at 4:48 AM
aye, I'm just worried like

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:49 AM
but smarter wolves with some system of communicating with each other complex-ish tasks could do it pretty easily.

MausLast Tuesday at 4:49 AM
Huge dire wolves may be way too on the nose

MausLast Tuesday at 4:50 AM
* I don't mind the idea too much, since Wolves are cool, and biggre wolves are even cooler, but it's done a lote.
* I could see wolves using human society nearby to get some advantages too

DruinLast Tuesday at 12:03 PM
* Although in regards to the US social consciousness I will give you that wolves have an almost benevolent place.
* So your idea has some merit.

“They have extremely high metabolisms and year-round activity in cold climates,” says Dechmann. “Their tiny bodies are like turbocharged Porsche engines that burn through energy stores in a matter of hours.”

To the scientists, it was clear that shrinking energetically costly tissue, such as the brain, allows the animals to reduce their energetic needs. “We understood that Dehnel’s phenomenon helps these animals survive when times are tough,” says Dechmann. “But we still didn’t understand what were the real pressure points, the exact environmental triggers, driving this process.”

#  Unsorted inspiration

1.  The peacock mantis shrimp can throw a punch at 50 mph, accelerating quicker than a .22-caliber bullet.  
1. There was once a type of crocodile that could gallop.  
1. Lynx have large feet that enable them to run on very deep snow.  
1. Lions inhabited many areas of europe until they were hunted to extinction in the region around 100 bce.  
1. **Hemolymph**  
Insects have an open circulatory system, in which their blood, called "hemolymph," bathes the organs. The insect "heart" is a segmented and chambered vessel running along the animal's back. This vessel contracts to send hemolymph forward toward the head; from there, it sloshes around back into the rest of the body. Hemolympyh is typically clear but can be greenish or yellowish, as anyone knows who has seen certain bugs splatter on their windshield or underfoot.  

1. Axolotls are underwater salamanders that have a remarkable ability to regenerate. Not only can they re-grow their limbs, but also complex organs such as their hearts and brains. What’s more, axolotls can absorb dismembered parts from other axolotls. These guys also put Wolverine to shame in the healing department.
1. metamorphosis  
Salamander development is highly diverse  
some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transitioning from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults  
(Axolotl), display paedomorphosis and never develop into terrestrial adults.  
Within genus Ambystoma, species have evolved to be paedomorphic several times  
paedomorphosis and complete development can both occur in some species.[12]

1. These beetles can spray a boiling-hot liquid out its behind when it’s threatened. When they sense danger, a chemical process gets triggered in their abdomen. Hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide get mixed together, which turns into a super-heated and noxious chemical.  
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_biology  
1. Rogue waves  
    Despite numerous anecdotal eyewitness accounts about rogue waves, there wasn't any hard scientific evidence for them, so such claims were dismissed as myths or legends. In fact, a French naval officer in 1826, Jules Dumont d'Urville, reported seeing a 108-foot-high wave in the Indian Ocean and was roundly ridiculed by physicist François Arago for his trouble. At the time, scientists didn't think waves could be higher than 30 feet.

Injecting tentacle? exploding sack on a stick?  

1. **Metamorphosis**  
  Rapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is resorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a big jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, a tongue is formed, and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks (development of stereoscopic vision, loss of the lateral line system, etc.) All this can happen in about a day, so it is truly a metamorphosis. It is not until a few days later that the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxin concentrations required for tail resorption.

1. **Hormone**  
( hormao: (verb) to excite or arouse.)  
a substance that sets in motion a set of metabolic events that would otherwise lie dormant.  
All of the hormones together form a communication network in the body that is called the endocrine system. Another way of viewing the endocrine system is to imagine at any given moment the circulatory system (the blood) of animals and humans is literally packed with thousands of these chemical messengers moving about the body sort of like an urban freeway on a late Friday afternoon.

One interesting feature that doesn’t get as much attention is their curious teeth, which they use to dig with. Their lower incisors are permanently on show on the outside of the animal’s lips and can move independently of each other, almost like a pair of chopsticks. This means that mole rats can dig with their teeth, without getting too much soil in their mouths. Amazingly, naked mole rats have also been seen inserting the husks of tubers behind their incisors, placing them delicately in front of their lips to act as a face mask against the dirt.

Various paranormal interpretations appeared in popular culture, and one of the more outspoken proponents of rods as alien life forms was the late Jose Escamilla, who claimed to have been the first to film them on March 19, 1994 at Roswell, New Mexico, while attempting to film a UFO. Escamilla later made additional videos and embarked on lecture tours to promote his claims.[1]

:“Prions are distorted versions of normal proteins found in human and animal brain and other tissues,” explains Colorado State University’s Prion Research Center. “These distorted (‘misfolded’) proteins damage brain cells, leading to fatal dementias akin to human Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.”

When normal proteins in your brain–for some reason that’s not fully understood–misfold, “they turn into contagious pathogens that recruit any other prions they come into contact with, grouping together in clumps that damage other cells and eventually cause the brain itself to break down,” writes Fiona MacDonald for ScienceAlert.

“...Technically speaking, proteins shouldn't be able to infect other proteins–they're not alive, after all–and scientists have never really been able to explain the behaviour of prions–hence their reputation as the weirdest molecules ever,”  she writes.

Manfred Eigen showed that the heterodimer model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing the rate of the conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015.[44] This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.

The mechanism of prion replication has implications for designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug does not need to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that the most effective way to achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.[51]

incorporate the transponder into the body, but i have no idea how thatd be cool or interesting  
If you were going to do something like that wolves would need to be a...very very big threat.  
"Transponder readings show a wolf pack moving south in our general direction if they don't change course we could see them in two weeks" "Jesus fuck call the government and see if they can get some armor out here"  
Well my reasoning is mechanical if that makes sense.  
if they are pre-transpondered and pre-warning system'd.  
They need to be scary. Scarier than the devil dogs even.

		All living creatures produce an electrical field by muscle contractions, and a shark may pick up weak electrical stimuli from the muscle contractions of animals, particularly prey.[4] On the other hand, the electrochemical fields generated by paralyzed prey were sufficient to elicit a feeding attack from sharks and rays in experimental tanks; therefore muscle contractions are not necessary to attract the animals. Sharks and rays can locate prey buried in the sand, or DC electric dipoles that simulate the main feature of the electric field of a prey buried in the sand. 
		
		This could mean that sharks and rays can orient to the electric fields of oceanic currents, and use other sources of electric fields in the ocean for local orientation.
		
		find when sharks diverged from a land creature, give that land creature the mutated ampullae
		
		The gel is a glycoprotein based substance with the same resistivity as seawater, and it has electrical properties similar to a semiconductor.

	Pigs have panoramic vision of approximately 310° and binocular vision of 35° to 50°. It is thought they have no eye accommodation.[73] Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g. sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects.

	Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in Europe where they are trained to locate underground truffles. Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs.[76] Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head.
	
	Pigs use auditory stimuli extensively as a means of communication in all social activities.[77] Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by pheromones.[78] Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.[79] 
	
	Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.[9] 

Boar
Stalker features
	Zone boars resist radiation well, which allows them to spend long periods in heavily contaminated areas.
	
	The animal's hooves have changed in shape and become sharper, acquiring a resemblance to claws.
	
	They are also cannibalistic,
	
	Boar's hooves can be used to produce a number of drugs, including an antiradiation serum.[1] According to the trader Barkeep, jewelers are interested in boar's horns and hooves from which they can create jewels. [2] 
	
	

scientific features
	The wild boar is a bulky, massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs. The trunk is short and massive, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile.
	
	The animal's head is very large, taking up to one-third of the body's entire length.[3] The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil:[33] it is capable of digging 8–10 cm (3.1–3.9 in) into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing 40–50 kg (88–110 lb).[9]
	
	It seems that smaller animals are capable of tolerating doses better, but swine are capable of shrugging off radioactive injuries very fast

Wolverines have thick, dark, oily fur which is highly hydrophobic, making it resistant to frost. This has led to its traditional popularity among hunters and trappers as a lining in jackets and parkas in Arctic conditions. A light-silvery facial mask is distinct in some individuals, and a pale buff stripe runs laterally from the shoulders along the side and crossing the rump just above a 25–35 cm (9.8–13.8 in) bushy tail. Some individuals display prominent white hair patches on their throats or chests.[5]
