# Five step approach


> During my narrative design career, I’ve been lucky enough to get a bit of practice at monster creation. Before the concept artists or game designers, it’s a narrative designer’s job to build the world and populate it with beings that often become in-game creatures. I was also fortunate enough to be able to attend a talk by [Delaney King on “Art Monsters”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFabx0qvG0g&feature=youtu.be) where she laid out the four fears we should consider when designing a monster.

## Step 1 - theme - Decide how I want my role-player to feel when they encounter my monster.
Two words. “Creeped out!” I wanted a type of ‘body snatcher’ that can masquerade as a human and cause deadly conflicts within a community. But I didn’t want to go with the classic ‘pod people’ or doppelganger way. I wanted something that would get under the reader/player’s skin and crawl around in there. There’s a subset of Fear of Infection, you see, and that’s Fear of Infestation. That’s why I looked to nature and settled on centipedes, cockroaches and maggots.

## Step 2 - Write a short ‘biology’ profile for my monster.
> **Species:** Seeder
> 
> **Function:** Sow human dissent and cause intra-community conflict
> 
> **Biology:**
> 
> Seeders are made up of a swarm of smaller creatures. Most commonly, these creatures take the form of centipedes although other forms, such as cockroaches and maggots, do occur. 
## Step 3 - Write a ‘behavior’ profile to “Establish the Danger”.
> 
> Then I decide the sort of damage I want my monster to cause and how they inflict that damage. When it comes to Seeders, I’m not really talking about combat damage. I’m focusing on what makes this creature monstrous. How does it destroy the lives of everyday people? How does it become a source of fear and dread?
#### Behavior:
> 
> Seeders insinuate themselves into a human community by targeting an existing member of that community. This is usually someone who is respected and has a great deal of social cache. The Seeder will then spend an extended period of time, from six months to a year, observing that individual in every accessible portion of their lives. It does this by mobilizing its sub-creatures, putting the target human under 24 hour surveillance. During this time, the Seeder learns the mark’s language, speech patterns, routines and behaviors. It continues this observation phase until it has learned enough to mimic that individual with 100% accuracy.
> 
> Once the observation phase is complete, the Seeder will ambush the target individual and kill them. The sub-creatures will then completely consume the victim’s corpse, flesh, organs and bone. They will use the resulting nutrients to excrete the exterior shell that will disguise this humanoid mass of huddled monstrosities.
> 
> With the target human gone, and the disguise in place, the Seeder will then assume their new identity and use it to sow dissent among the community.


> a Seeder will use its sub-creatures to spy on the other community members, learning their secrets. It does this by releasing individual creatures through ruptures in its shell. The ruptures are quickly repaired to maintain the integrity of the disguise. Through rumor, lies, seduction and deceit the Seeder plays community members off against each other, raising tensions until the community turns on itself, tearing itself apart in a frenzy of fury and hatred.

### Step 5 - Google It! Ask around. Due your due diligence.
> 
> Finally, I do a series of internet searches to see if I can find anything that’s similar to the monster I’ve just created. I ask my friends and colleagues in the writing and games industries if they’ve heard of anything like it. I search the monster’s name to see what it will be associated with. If I do find something similar, I make the necessary adjustments to make sure it’s not similar.

# The sublime in monsters
> The word has many applications: a cathedral or a mountain may be sublime, as may a thought, a heroic deed, or a mode of expression. But the definition of the sublime is not restricted to value judgements; it also describes a state of mind. The vertiginous depths of the Grand Canyon instil a sense of awe; King Lear’s dying words fill the audience with lofty emotion; the idea of infinity is beyond words.

Shaw, Philip. The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom) (p. 1). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition. 

> Since the concept was first presented in Peri hypsous or On the Sublime, an aesthetic treatise commonly attributed to Longinus, a philosopher, literary critic and rhetorician of the first or third century CE (on the question of attribution see Doran 2015: 30–1 and Heath 1999), the sublime has stood, variously, for the effect of grandeur in speech and poetry; for a sense of the divine; for the contrast between the limitations of human perception and the overwhelming majesty of nature; as proof of the triumph of reason over nature and imagination and, most recently, as a signifier for that which exceeds the grasp of reason. 


> Edmund Burke (1729–1797; discussed in chapter 3). In anticipation of Shelley’s stunned evocation of the violent otherness of the alpine landscape, Burke writes appreciatively of nature’s destructive powers. In his landmark A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful (1757; 1990), however, the threat of violence is mitigated by the effects of distance: an erupting volcano may well induce terror in the mind of one about to be engulfed by lava, but to the distant spectator the sight could be experienced as a form of delight. In this secularised version of Burnet’s apocalypse, the viewer may exercise a facility for aesthetic contemplation; the volcano is judged not to be a threat to life and is perceived instead as an… — location: [328](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B071H6X3VJ&location=328) ^ref-21054

> Yet such instinctive feeling for the transcendental is rare these days. As a result of secularism, together with increasing global awareness and media sophistication, we seem less inclined to regard the breakdown of reason and expression as indicators of a higher or spiritual realm.

Shaw, Philip. The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom) (p. 4). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition. 


>   The poem is structured around core 'religious' and Christian-centric questions by the persona concerning 'the creature' including the phrase "Who made thee?". These questions use the repetition of [alliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliteration "Alliteration") ("frame" and "fearful") combined with [imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagery "Imagery") (burning, fire, eyes) to frame the arc of the poem.

> The first stanza opens the poem with a central line of questioning stating "What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?". This direct address to the creature serves as a foundation for the poem's contemplative style as "the Tyger" cannot provide the persona with a satisfactory answer. The second stanza questions "the Tyger" about where he was created, while the third stanza sees the focus move from the tiger, the creation, to the creator.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyger#cite_note-Kazin-10) 
> The fourth stanza questions what tools were used in the tiger's creation. In the fifth stanza, the narrator wonders how the creator reacted to "the Tyger", and questions who created the creature.


> "The Tyger" is the sister poem to "[The Lamb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lamb_(poem) "The Lamb (poem)")" (from "[Songs of Innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Innocence "Songs of Innocence")"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective, with "The Lamb" bringing attention to innocence. In "The Tyger", there is a duality between beauty and ferocity, with Blake suggesting that understanding one requires an understanding of the other.

> The "Songs of Experience" were written as contrary to the "Songs of Innocence" – a recurring theme in Blake's philosophy and work.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyger#cite_note-Kazin-10) Blake argues that humankind's struggles have their origin in the contrasting nature of concepts. Truth, his poetry demonstrates, lays in comprehending the contradictions between innocence and experience. To Blake, experience is not the face of evil but rather another component of existence.

> Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. According to Kazin, in "The Tyger" he presents a poem of "triumphant human awareness" and "a hymn to pure being".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyger#cite_note-Kazin-10)


> The tiger has a “fearful symmetry” (4, 24) as it inspires fear and is also symmetrical. The [symmetry](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/symmetry) of the tiger implies a sense of order and beauty in the tiger, yet when used with the word “fearful” the meaning transforms. 

> “Fearful symmetry” implies that the tiger has been intentionally made to inspire fear with its unpredictable violence and terror. In these lines the speaker is acknowledging that whoever created the tiger has a capacity much greater than human abilities, while also questioning why any being, no matter how powerful, would create this fear inciting creature.
