Pig mutant creature
	an assimilator?
		stretched out transformation? - with the sinews organs and muscles showing under a frame that's much too large for its mass?
		like the bear from the movie annihilation

* boars being walking tumor monstrosities would fit.
* Massive, hogzilla?
## Pigs
* Vomiting bone matter congealing
* upright movement because hips are similar
* based on the thing mixed with the reanimator

The assimilator is capable of collecting organic and inorganic matter to build. It may also reproduce by warping organic matter into additional creatures for the colony like cancer cells.

It prefers organic matter

can temporarily activate dead tissue and use the senses of other creatures for security purposes

You know that the redundant lung idea may work best with pigs.

Speaking of, we could have pigs that could like pick up new body parts and use them
Or boar, theyre walking cancer blobs

That said i don't have a good sell rn, but i do have to say that mouse hunt is a great movie
