Pig mutant creature
- an assimilator?
	- stretched out transformation? - with the sinews organs and muscles showing under a frame that's much too large for its mass?
	- like the bear from the movie annihilation

* boars being walking tumor monstrosities would fit.
* Massive, hogzilla?
## Pigs
* Vomiting bone matter congealing
* upright movement because hips are similar
* based on the thing mixed with the reanimator

The assimilator is a creature that can collect both organic and inorganic materials to build or reproduce, often transforming organic matter into new creatures like walking cancer cells for its colony. It prefers recently deceased organic matter, but can temporarily activate dead tissue to use the senses of other creatures for security. The idea of using redundant lungs might work well, or pick up and use new body parts..
