# Summary
 Terraformer class manipulator
 
  Extremely crafty
  
sources: See xfiles, oil creatures
## Keynotes
high level eerie intelligence, barely human, that outwits the party
## Biology
Ferrofluid black biped

the external flesh is a dark aqueous color, with a matrix of spine-like 'feathers' binding it to a muscular-skeletal layer underneath. with enough stretching, the muscular layer is visible

has a mask-like covering made of a hard material
- This mask is transformable by manipulation with the hands
- the mask is periodically shed by moulting
- under the mask is bright orange flesh and bare skull unless moulting, when a second layer of mask replaces the first

dresses in leftover clothes or local fauna like strips of treebark

coats in mud and sometimes vegetation to cover up the black signature

## Tabletop
5 Durability, 15 trauma
size +0, 6'6"
# special qualities
- Ghillie - the Ranchhand can take local vegetation and place it into his body as natural scrim. Roll fieldcraft and add the margin of success to their camouflage value until the vegetation wilts or they leave the region.
- Reach - The Ranchhand's starting reach is 1 meter.
# Minutiae
- Ranchhands have mastered stone age technology
- They do not have comprehension of Human language, instead relying on body language
- Ranchhands have a prediliction for using the arts to their advantage. They often paint or dye their masks, homes, or tools with glyphs and designs.
- No discernable language has been found, but ranchhands often share glyphs, handsigns.
- features
	- bipedal
	- craft tool user
	- post-human sapience
