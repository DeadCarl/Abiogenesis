# Summary
de novo parasitic infection

explore the idea of using scabies as a basis for a threat in a game, noting their rapid spread, difficulty to eradicate, and ability to latch onto hosts. The challenge is to incorporate an anomalous element to make it engaging, 'beatable' and manageable in gameplay, perhaps avoiding the clich√© of zombies. The participants discuss the potential for scabies to be a foundational element for something else, acknowledging that while disturbing concepts can make for compelling stories, they might not always translate well into playable scenarios. 

# Candidate 1: Eels
ambush predator that jumps out of crevices or bodies it is hiding in

The idea involves a parasitic eel the size of a moray which burrows and hides in its prey or other soft material like sand through the fourth dimension. The burrowing effect would appear to be tiny slits in the victim's body.. The eels would be ambush predators, using the fourth dimension as cover and being visible through shadows spilling over into the third dimension. They could also be killed by a single hit from most firearms. An added twist would be to have the creature hijack the victim's body so they would be alive, but compelled to seek help and thus help spread the eels while being eaten from the inside.

# Candidate 2: Scabies

Sure but it has to be even weirder. DNA warping scabies, survivable plenty of people stay within a safe genetic range, others get that tiny iota of change that makes their brain shit, turns into a range of physiological changes? Brundlefly shit?

Asbestos forces the body's metabolism into overdrive, subsisting on its victims body mass.

Players could be automatically in the safe genetic range, so they have an immunity pass to avoid body horror for the players directly. just have a scar from them being pushed out of the body by the immune system

These scabies are contact mutagenic?

ASBESTOS: BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE FIBERS ONCE THEY ACTUALLY MATURE. THE SCABIES LOOKING ONES ARE JUST THE EARLIEST STAGE OF LIFE

Also lets you use one thing for multiple hostiles. certain morphs happen more often for variety
- lil babbies
- the big baddies
- and the meddl goobers
## Treatment

Add in anti-parasitic cream as a treatment option once found and the clock can be pushed back. Treat the town, clean room them all, fumigate fucking everything.

But it just looks like common scabies up front, takes time for the weird shit to happen raising Fed boi attention

so they start small but can turn into a massive fucking monster problem? It's a fucking X-file right there!

# Devil dog

Devil dogs are canines in the latter stages of Asbestos infection. These creatures are highly malnourished and extremely aggressive due to their anguish, and often experience cognitive or physical decline.

Afflicted dog populations sometimes become stable enough to reproduce in the wild. Pups are subsequently infected upon birth.

# hemorrhagic Mange
	
	Cross ebola with mange
	Zoonotic
	initial symptoms are the formation of intensely itching burrowing patches, grotesque red blemishes and bald patches, and the formation of crust
	If caught early, the mite can be dug out with a knife, but with time they burrow into the body, suppress the immune system and hijack the metabolism of the victim: the body goes into overdrive as it breaks down trying to feed the mites that may result in internal or external bleeding.
	
	Over time confusion develops as the body's metabolic demand forces it into starvation mode: the victim becomes aggressive and delirious from hunger and is compelled to find any sort of sustenance. The disease is highly contagious, victims have a hard time recovering naturally, and death is likely. Extended symptomatic periods lead to cognitive and physical decline, even after treatment, as a result of extensive malnutrition.
	
	the Contagion is spread by contact with the skin cells or mites of an afflicted character. The mites live only for a few days without a host.
	
	features
		double aggression

	blue limbs and ugly white naked skin?

 Bloody pack hunter  
 Winged, 4 legged 'mammal' about the size of a dog that's like a killer bee
 "A field of headless birds left strewn across their hunting grounds for miles, added one by one."  
 "a pack of them sitting on top of a powerline"
 Attacks anything in its territory. May not eat the meat.  
 Will regularly attack humans, livestock  
 Swarms threats, pulls them apart  
 Partial flying sprinters, can leap to catch low flying birds  
 Can attack armored vehicles, don't give a shit

I am not artistic in that regard.  
Even if I can come up with a mental image I can't wordificate it.  
Like we could go horror aesthetic with mange and such.  
or you could go the strangely majestic route of a healthy coyote.  
like the skin flaps bit don't take up a lot of space on a sugar glider.  
a bit like a pouch on a cat that runs the whole torso  

### Background

In California, a population Coyotes exposed to de Kuiper fallout lost the ability to efficiently digest food. Caught short of the necessary nutrients, their eating habits slowly changed as they found that only rotted flesh became their only source. This began to breed true.

### Description & Disposition

Dog like shape, has sugar glider wings, strong leaping legs?, seasonal migration pattern

**Size and weight**  
About the size of a german shepherd (new)sound aight?  
lightweight, maybe a boney appearanxe; leanness is necessary to make them look glide capable  
say something more akin to a coyote in size; lean  
 Body length ranges on average from 1.0 to 1.35 m with a weight of around 40 pounds is a coyote.

2.2 feet is similar for both shepherds and coyos apparently

* one problem with coyotes and dogs in general in the case of the wing glider skin though is their range of movement.
* dogs look...weird spread out like that.

* maybe cognitive dissonance level weird is my concern
* we would need an artist to really decide if that would work though.

Ecosystem
* Now ideally we would want a niche for them to fit in the ecosystem.
* But that one is actually easy, we killed all the wolves.
* They do what wolves used to do, they just happen to also be real good at killing people. Like wolves.


### Keynotes
let's step back from the name and focus on what it does and why it is a threat.  
There may be an aesthetic we are missing for design by being married to the name ya dig?  
I think it was pretty decent gliding+climbing: Idea would be the sugar glider skin, big flappy capesuit  

Rules of engagement
 but yeah we have these keynotes for understanding a bit of them, now we make them intelligent, things that attack tend to attack again, this works well with pack mentality because pack animals are smarter.  
 Don't let something that hurt you get away if you can finish it off, standard shit.  

 * Winged flight.
 * Apex Predator
 * Pack oriented

 * malicious.
  * in and of itself makes an animal a bit unbelievable for turbo spergs.
  * crocs and alligators have answered killing when they have food
  * Preference for carrion and the need for it, for food beyond what the area provides: crocs don't get their needed nutrients from fresh food.rot produces vitamins and shit.

  * Why do they not roam TOO much? need a place to take things to rot.
  * They have a range limit because of this, now you can spice this up, make them seasonal, they move with the seasons to areas they have warrens. But this is spit balling.
  * So either likes carrion or tolerates it, may bury carcasses or leave them out, has a voracious appetite
  * Maybe its mouth is a bacteriological hazard by the carrion

* See I like the idea of them being coyotes, they are pretty common in those regions, wolves are...not numerous.
* like we have a real good idea of how many grey wolves are in the US.
* And it ain't a lot.

* I mean separate from devil dogs
* I had a random concept but im not sure it's good

MausLast Tuesday at 4:14 AM
* Heres a curveball
* Are devil dogs actually a coyote mutant or are they abiogenic

MausLast Tuesday at 4:16 AM
Alright. So a coyo mutant

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:17 AM
And coyotes have a bit of a place in the... social consciousness.

DruinLast Tuesday at 4:17 AM
* people don't worry about wolves in the US unless they basically live in Canada.
* but coyotes are an every day thing.
