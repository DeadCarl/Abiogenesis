# "Sniper nest"

a sniper nest of bee-like entities

- But I mean being shot with an angry bee that is now crawling inside of you, trying to eat and cut. even if it can't actually do so well or fast, the fucking psychic damage of it wriggling and buzzing inside of you.

I always did want to try and do my own take on the Lekgolo in this game

especially if it is say a hive structure creature, An ambulatory queen bee
hive combo

Or maybe not even ambulatory, their hive structures are designed to make those channels
and then they all just like buzz their wings in the right places to make the pressure channels work

take BEEMAN and have it teleshit the flying creature, maybe the flyer only reaches bullet velocity with its assistance

it's gonna mess you up

you've got the MGS3 "the Pain" option] Shooting BEES BEE NADE TOMBEE GUN Although I'd call that a minion option
