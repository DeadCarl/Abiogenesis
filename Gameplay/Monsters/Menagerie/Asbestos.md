Ya know, scabies might make an interesting basis for a threat in abibio
[10:57 AM]
Horrific little things.
[10:58 AM]
Spread rapidly, hard to kill, latch in to the host. But how do you add in the anomalous angle?
[10:59 AM]
How do you make it interesting but also plausibly "beatable" as opposed to a background setting thing not really relevant to play.
[11:00 AM]
zombies is the obvious answer
[11:00 AM]
but a bit too obvious

Maus — Today at 11:01 AM
well, to be fair, you did say "as a basis"
[11:01 AM]
so it could be an indirect thing for something else
[11:01 AM]
that said one second
[11:01 AM]
have to wiki ti
[11:02 AM]
you know, I actually did have a disturbing idea for this

Druin — Today at 11:02 AM
I mean there are LOADS of disturbing ones, but they make bad play, good story.

Maus — Today at 11:02 AM
sure
[11:02 AM]
lemme see if I wrote anything more on it

Maus — Today at 11:13 AM
mm, that looks like I didn't write it down. Guess I'll have to go by memory.

So the idea was basically a parasitic eel about the size of a moray that could burrow into prey, then hide inside the body by entering the fourth dimension. The burrowing effect would appear to be tiny slits in the victim's body. 

They would be ambush predators, partially using the fourth dimension as cover and being visible by shadows that spill over into the third dimension, using soft material like sand or soft tissue as burrowing material. A single hit from most firearms would do them in.
[11:17 AM]
to sweeten it, a possibility would be to have the creature hijack the victim's body so they would be alive, but compelled to seek help and thus help spread them.

Though I don't think that's required. Maybe that should be reserved for zombie type thing.
[11:17 AM]
Though fourth dimensional parasitic super eels does sound unique as fuck

Druin — Today at 11:18 AM
I mean the scabies angle fits there, has a bit of a cordyceps angle with the compelled to act against interests to spread
[11:18 AM]
But zombies is just so damn cliche.
[11:19 AM]
You have to have zombies somewhere but scabies isn't weird enough

Maus — Today at 11:19 AM
to be fair the compel angle can be natural. You're dying, after all
[11:19 AM]
also there's a sort of inspiration that comes from these guys

Revivers, also known as Runners and mostly called Lightning Dog by Alyx Vance, are hostile creatures that inhabit the Quarantine Zone in City 17. They spit electrically charged liquid which can...

[11:21 AM]
the other part is the victim is obstensibly alive, though being eaten from the inside

Druin — Today at 11:21 AM
Sure but it has to be even weirder. DNA warping scabies, survivable plenty of people stay within a safe genetic range, others get that tiny iota of change that makes their brain shit, turns into a range of physiological changes?
[11:21 AM]
Brundlefly shit?
[11:21 AM]
Gives players an immunity pass.
[11:21 AM]
So that you can avoid body horror for the players directly

Maus — Today at 11:22 AM
oh that's a possibility that they are contact mutagenic

Druin — Today at 11:22 AM
just have a scar from them being pushed out of the body by the immune system

Maus — Today at 11:23 AM
Sounds like we've got a scabies monster then

Druin — Today at 11:25 AM
Add in anti-parasitic cream as a treatment option once found and the clock can be pushed back
[11:25 AM]
Treat the town, clean room them all, fumigate fucking everything.

Maus — Today at 11:26 AM
ICU surgical suite-

Druin — Today at 11:26 AM
But it just looks like common scabies up front, takes time for the weird shit to happen raising Fed boi attention

Maus — Today at 11:26 AM
so they start small but can turn into a massive fucking monster problem?
[11:26 AM]
Kinda xenomorphy

Druin — Today at 11:26 AM
It's a fucking X-file right there!

Maus — Today at 11:27 AM
I LIKE IT
[11:27 AM]
what's our dev name for them
[11:27 AM]
other than a scoobie

Druin — Today at 11:27 AM
Scritchies I dunno
[11:28 AM]
Itchies?
[11:28 AM]
Presents with skin iritation and itching to help spread them just like scabies.

Maus — Today at 11:28 AM
could call them a papercut?

Druin — Today at 11:29 AM
nah, more in line with those hole-phobia pictures once they really take root

Maus — Today at 11:29 AM
hmm
