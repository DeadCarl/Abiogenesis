# Fear Country - Outlaw
When you've got no past but still trying to find a future.

Fear County is set at the end of the west, the last stronghold of the old pioneers before the land dips into the pacific ocean or passes the state lines into former california.

“Old Klamath used to have its own streak of the weird. Most of daily life is still like that, just that little bit weird, that little rough: Pale problems like the wells too dry or the hours too short for next week’s dinner. Sometimes people talk about the mysterious homicide half an hour from the next county, their missing cat or a kid that ran away. But then you remember that you have to lock the door, leave the dosimeter out, keep an ear for state emergency messages. If everything works, you have 15 minutes to find your little black rifle.

New Klamath gets surreal. Lots of concealed carriers. …(stuff here) Going to california is like taking a vacation to Fukushima.

We learned fast that bombers heading south means as much as a WEA, but the real chills start when hear the bombs hit - don’t go out for anything then, even your mother calling your name. I know good men that did - construction workers, soldiers, park rangers. They’re all gone like straw in the wind.”

## History

Klamath falls after its heyday had a population of 20,000, with a slowdown in the 2010s to 3% growth. With its history of timber and agriculture curtailed by environmental concerns and poor economic performance, Klamath was not positioned to quickly expand its job market.

Because it had a comfortable tax base with a growth that wasn’t too fast, klamath entered a period of trying to rejuvenate the downtown area which had fallen to urban decay.

When the de Kuiper event struck, Klamath was not immediately harmed, but saw a troubling rise in crime and accidents within weeks. When the shock impacted global markets, klamath saw its ability to secure loans and its businesses fold under the pressure as city councillors fought to stabilize the tax base by economizing services.

6 months later, sacramento was evacuated by presidential order. Klamaths’ sister city, Medford became a northern staging area for the main supply route into California by the Oregon National Guard. 3 years later, the state of California declared bankruptcy, spilling millions of internally displaced refugees out of the state.
Klamaths population trebled within months, reaching 68,000 people in record time without homes, food, shelter, or work, and needed to act quickly in order to save the city from collapse. That work is still ongoing.
## Interstate 5
2 months ago, Interstate 5, a major artery, experienced an unidentified event that rendered it impassable to all traffic, cutting Medford and Klamath from safe northbound service.  service to local government, federal aid, and migrant workers was stalled.

Left alone to its own devices, Oregon state government handed half of the bill to the impacted counties. To address the situation, county governments created a public fund for the work, then contracted out the road work to a construction company based in klamath.

## Socioeconomics
- immigration and refugees: I like the idea of Abibo having multiple cultures show up; how do we correctly grab units like Chinese or Russian State forces with heavy equipment like tanks in CONUS without starting WWIII, or civilian foreigners?
- Central, South Americans would be likely to move. So would Californians.

Collapse of businesses

The decade is widely remembered as a time of crime, violence, lawlessness, disorder, graffiti-covered subways, inflation, unemployment, and budgets completely out of control—an era of social breakdown, economic malaise, and political collapse.3
