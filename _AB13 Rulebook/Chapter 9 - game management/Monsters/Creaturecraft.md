### Size
A squad has the special attribute of size, which represents the number of individual NPCs in the squad. Size has various effects on the squad’s actions, traits, and checks, such as the number of attacks or their morale.
### Psionic Rating
Psi is a reservoir of power used to manifest a psionic ability. Some abilities require expending psionic points, while others may simply require having a prerequisite number, but no cost.

If not specified, the psionic reservoir is refilled after a full rest by default.

Creatures are the new monsters produced by the de kuiper event. They Can be an organism or a construct

# General
## Kaiju
## Tyrant
Tyrants are a monster type characterized by a seemingly unstoppable durability or relentless pursuit.

Typically, tyrant types have a high coverage of effective small arms resistance - ordinary wounds just don't hurt them - and require light weapons or greater to engage conventionally. An armor value of 10 or higher is a good place to start for fear country campaigns, along with a high potential for mayhem and the endurance to constantly chase targets. High health or regeneration may also substitute for resistance, though this isn't necessary if the target can't be hurt in the first place. 

Sidenote: The stuff of slasher horror movies, the tyrant takes its name from the bioweapons of resident evil. Examples include mr x, the thing, leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre, and so on.

## Critter

## Mutant
## Designer creature
Designer creatures are a type of monster that are the product of an intelligent designer for a special purpose

Designer creatures are characterized by high specialization and hardcoded directives to do the task they were made for. 

Sidenote: Examples are the terminator series, the engineers from halo, and the t virus creations from resident evil.

Rat
A small, weak, and basic enemy.
The Rat is the weakest, most basic enemy in the FPS genre, usually about the size of a house cat. Sometimes, they have projectiles, sometimes they crawl at you and attempt to melee, and sometimes they explode when they attack, but the basic idea is the same. Typically, they die in a couple shots from the basic pistol, but are fairly common in the early levels and/or interfere with your ability to deal with other enemies

Trigger

An enemy that must be treated with care otherwise something bad will happen.  
The Trigger is a type of Zombie or Soldier that will, if treated the wrong way, become a much greater threat to the player.

Ninja
An enemy that is fast, stealthy, or agile.
In many ways, the Ninja is the opposite of the Heavy. Instead of being much stronger than the basic Mook, he's much faster - or she is. If there's a female mook, it's often the Ninja. The Ninja has very high movement speed, and is usually also very agile, having moves not available to standard Mooks such as being able to climb walls or make two-story jumps to move up to higher platforms. In extreme cases they can outright teleport. Ninjas usually prefer melee attacks, or are at least limited to light weapons such as pistols or submachine guns. They're often equipped with some form of cloaking device as well. Surprisingly, the Ninja isn't really a Fragile Speedster, and can usually survive at least as much damage as a standard Soldier Mook.

https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:PurpleWii/Archetype_Classification(PurpleWii_Edition)

Carry

A Carry is the hero that the team rallies around in the late game. The role's name is derived from the act of "carrying" a team, which is to bear the responsibility of leading the team to victory. The carry is expected to have the largest contribution to the team, and is critical in winning team fights.

Nuker

Nukers are heroes with abilities that deliver high burst damage throughout the game. Their goal is to give the team an advantage by killing enemy heroes before they can react to team fights.

Initiator

Initiators are heroes who can safely start a team fight. These heroes typically have a strong area of effect or special skill to affect the positioning of the enemy team.

Disabler

Disablers are heroes with abilities more focused on reliable crowd control, either by single target or area of effect. They can act as initiators in small skirmishes, or as support by holding the enemy down for the carry to finish off.

Durable

Durable heroes are capable of sustaining large amounts of incoming damage. They tend to have high HP, HP regeneration, healing, magic resistance, or status resistance. They often have abilities to mitigate damage, avoid damage completely, or weaken the power of enemies.

Escape

Escape heroes are equipped with one or more escape mechanisms which allow them (and sometimes their allies) to avoid damage while retreating or repositioning themselves during a team fight

Supports

Supports are heroes who keep their allies alive and give them opportunities to earn more gold and experience. Supports will usually come with skills such as healing spells or disables, and generally have low damage output but a powerful (yet situational) nuke

Pusher

Pushers focus on bringing down towers quickly, thereby acquiring map control. If they succeed, they often shut down the enemy carry by forcing them away from farming.

  The beetles' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator.[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-7) The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-benzoquinone, an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory system of vertebrates.
  The flow of reactants into the reaction chamber and subsequent ejection occur in a series of about 70 pulses, at a rate of about 500 pulses per second. The whole sequence of events takes only a fraction of a second. These pulsations are caused by repeated microexplosions which are the results of the continuous pressure on the reservoir and the oscillatory opening and closing of the valve that controls access to the reaction chamber. This pulsed mechanism is beneficial for the beetles' survival because the system uses pressure instead of muscles to eject the spray at a constant velocity, saving the beetle energy. Also, the reintroduction of new reactants into the vestibule where enzymes are stored, reduces the temperature of the chamber, thereby protecting the peroxidases and catalases from thermal denaturation.[8]

# Design, biology and aesthetics

# Question: Summarize the theme a monster needs to fit to elicit a proper response from the audience
# Themes
The creatures of abiogenesis can be divided into two sets of threats: common, and special.
### common
A common threat is a socially manageable threat to society. Individually, they may take up some resources to solve, but their larger threat is through failure to manage them correctly, or by overwhelming Society's resources in conjunction with other threats. This doesn't mean that common threats are easy to solve, as for instance Grizzly bears could be considered a real life example of one.

Common fictional threats include romero's social commentary slow zombies, monster world shows, and dinosaurs from jurassic park.
### special
A special threat is capable of destabilizing society on their own, and so can can directly threaten life as we know it. Special vectors irl include pandemics, natural disasters or unstoppable phenomena such as a nuclear power disaster or a wild fire. Special threats are precisely so because they can overwhelm a body's defenses, or have no real counter.

Special threats that defy social power must be rare. However, most horror movies about with terrifying antagonists make them special threats, such as the xenomorph, the thing, Cthulhu, psychic domination, or fast zombies from 28 days later.
### the xcom continuum

Outside of an individual story, an astute reader might realize that the line between a common threat and a special threat is fuzzy. For example, tremors and the xfiles have catastrophic threats to humanity that yet have the potential to be managed: in tremors case its the application of brilliant thinking, while in the xfiles the us government itself is compromised with corruption, unethical behavior and alien infiltration. 

Another example of how Special becomes a common continuum is to look at the game progression of XCOM. At the beginning, there are threats which the player has no real defense against except to flee or overwhelm.

## Challenge Variety
In abiogen, the common threat needs to have some variety of ways to solve the problem. Creatures need to be able to be solved by a variety of solutions such as being out maneuvered or outsmarted in addition to being outgunned. The fewer solutions available to the party, the more special the threat becomes.

Conversely, As an rpg setting set with modern weapons, abiogenesis has the unique problem of having to create creatures with low amounts of technology that provide a hard challenge to gun wielding humans. The meta of a successful challenge must accordingly change to make such assymetrical fights hard.

## Novelty over time

1. Each part of the bestiary should be new and exciting
2. The game needs to be able to sustain a degree of novelty over time

## It's a good idea to look from a few different angles
* Visual design
	* Modern shooters have trouble here because its easy for enemy designs to blur together, such as uniforms
		* we can use mechanical behavior
		* compensating with more outlandish concepts (armor, weapons, ridiculous uniforms)
* Mechanics - Behavior, systems

Modes of life

Competitive exclusion may be avoided if one or both of the competing species evolves to use a different resource, occupy a different area of the habitat, or feed during a different time of day. The result of this kind of evolution is that two similar species use largely non-overlapping resources and thus have different niches. This is called resource partitioning, and it helps the species coexist because there is less direct competition between them.

https://www.tiredearth.com/articles/ecological-habitat-and-niche-what%E2%80%99s-difference



The ecological niche describes how a species interacts within an ecosystem. The niche of a species depends on both biotic and abiotic factors, which affect the ability of a species to survive and endure.

Biotic factors affecting a species' niche include food availability and predators. Abiotic factors affecting ecological niche include temperature, landscape characteristics, soil nutrients, light and other non-living factors.

An example of an ecological niche is that of the dung beetle. The dung beetle, as its name suggests, consumes dung both in larval and adult form. Dung beetles store dung balls in burrows, and females lay eggs within them.

This allows hatched larvae immediate access to food. The dung beetle in turn influences the surrounding environment by aerating soil and rereleasing beneficial nutrients. Therefore, the dung beetle performs a unique role in its environment.


Ecologist Charles Elton’s definition of niche focused on the role of a species, such as its trophic role. His tenets emphasized more on community similarity and less on competition.

In 1957, Zoologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson provided a sort of compromise of these trains of thought. Hutchinson described two forms of niche. The fundamental niche focused on the conditions in which a species could exist with no ecological interactions. The realized niche, in contrast, considered the population’s existence in the presence of interactions, or competition.



Competition in a niche either leads each species to specialize in a different way, so as not to use the same resources, or leads one of the competing species to become extinct. This is another way of looking at natural selection. There are two theories used to address competitive exclusion.

In R* Theory, multiple species cannot exist with the same resources unless they differentiate their niches. When resource density is at its lowest, those species populations most limited by the resource will be competitively excluded.

In P* Theory, consumers can exist at high density due to having shared enemies.


Overlapping Niches/Resource Partitioning

Given the fact that organisms cannot exist in a bubble and must therefore naturally interact with other species, occasionally niches can overlap. To avoid competitive exclusion, similar species can change over time to use different resources.

In other cases, they can exist in the same area but use resources at different times. This scenario is called resource partitioning.

Resource partitioning: Partitioning means separating. Simply put, species can use their resources in ways that reduce depletion. This allows the species to coexist and even evolve.



Niche Construction Theory

Ecologists more recently have focused on niche construction theory, which describes how organisms modify their environments to make them better suited as niches. Examples of this include making burrows, building nests, creating shade, building beaver dams and other methods in which organisms alter their surroundings to suit their needs.

Niche construction arose from biologist John Odling-Smee. Odling-Smee argued that niche construction should be considered a process of evolution, a form of “ecological inheritance” passed on to descendents rather than a genetic inheritance.



There are four core principles behind niche construction theory:

    One involves
    non-random modification
    of the environment by a species, helping aid their evolution. 
    Second, the “ecological” inheritance alters evolution due to
    parents passing on the altering skills
    to their offspring.
    Third, new characteristics that are
    adopted
    become evolutionarily significant. The environments are affected systematically. 
    Fourth, what was considered adaptation is essentially the result of organisms making their environments more complementary via
    niche construction
    .

## Traits
The Reflex System uses both values and ratings to define a character's traits and abilities. A value is always numeric (e.g. 8), while a rating is always defined by a quantity of dice (e.g. 3d20).
### feral
Feral life such as terrestrial animals are rated on one attribute, cunning. Cunning measures feral intelligence and reasoning.

Most feral creatures do not possess skill ratings, but instead possess unique attribute ratings.
### Intelligent 
Intelligent, sapient life is rated on a quartet of mental attributes; cognition, education, Personality and resolve.

Intelligent NPC life possess a set of key skill ratings that define their role. Additionally, they possess a competence rating that represents their skills in everything irrelevant to their key skills.

Most human life has an attribute rating of 2L. Nonhuman intelligent life may possess unique attribute ratings like unintelligent life.

Sapience score, Sapience quotient - a conjectural value comparing a given creature to a human with the value unity, and to bare sentience at 0. Values above unity are said to be superhuman levels of sapience.

> Chaos is inherently universal as I have touched upon previously in my article about [Mr. Freeze’s Freezing Gun](https://cosmicchemist.com/2016/08/14/mr-freezes-freeze-gun/). In accordance with the 2nd law of thermodynamics, a closed system’s entropy (a statistical representation of the universal inclination towards chaos) can never decrease but only increase or remain constant. The Universe prefers chaos over order. If one were to fully characterize the Universe in the dramaturgical sense with humanity, or just living beings, as the protagonists, the Universe is certainly our antagonist. It stands staunchly against the very fabric of our being. The immense and extravagant complexities of life are a slap in the Universe’s face if you will.
