## Getting the tone right: Threats in Abiogenesis
Abiogenesis, like STALKER, runs its conflicts differently from many of the other related genres such as horror or survival horror. While the game shares some DNA with the conventions of Horror media past, one of the big differences is how unstoppable things feel. Compared with HP Lovecraft's works, Godzilla, or Alien, Creatures in Abiogenesis should typically only be insurmountable with good tactics. Instead, it's the environment and the continuous lurking danger of another that doesn't let up that creates the relentlessness typified in horror.

Therefore, remember the adage that "if it bleeds, we can kill it." tyrants and even less, kaiju should be rare as centerpieces - The true boogeyman of the setting should be the looming potential of the environment itself to devour society. Instead, place emphasis on threats and elites as the typical antagonists. 

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, the proportion of critters to tyrants are relative to the band's conventional capability. The Xenomorph of Alien fame is classed as a tyrant because the crew was essentially unarmed, while a company of infantry would likely see it as an elite problem, or a threat. A tank may make short work of smaller Kaiju, in which case it is reduced in threat threat as long as the tank is operational.
### the xcom continuum

Outside of an individual story, an astute reader might realize that the line between a common threat and a special threat is fuzzy. For example, tremors and the xfiles contain catastrophic threats to humanity, yet they may be manageable with enough : in tremors case its the application of good thinking and access to firepower, while in the xfiles there are actors in the US government trying to take control.

Another example is to look at XCOM's progression. In the beginning, there are threats which the team has very little practical chance to survive against except by overwhelming, fleeing, or incredibly good strategy, but by the endgame, the player's research becomes makes a veteran trooper practically their equal.

## Kaiju
## Tyrant
Tyrants are a monster type characterized by a seemingly unstoppable durability or relentless pursuit.

Typically, tyrant types have a high coverage of effective small arms resistance - ordinary wounds just don't hurt them - and require light weapons or greater to engage conventionally. An armor value of 10 or higher is a good place to start for fear country campaigns, along with a high potential for mayhem and the endurance to constantly chase targets. High health or regeneration may also substitute for resistance, though this isn't necessary if the target can't be hurt in the first place. 

Sidenote: The stuff of slasher horror movies, the tyrant takes its name from the bioweapons of resident evil. Examples include mr x, the thing, leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre, and so on.

A special type, Designer creatures are a type of monster that are the product of an intelligent designer for a special purpose

Designer creatures are characterized by high specialization and hardcoded directives to do the task they were made for. 

Sidenote: Examples are the terminator series, the engineers from halo, and the t virus creations from resident evil.

Mob

Caster

Boss

Obstacle

Rat
A small, weak, and basic enemy.
The Rat is the weakest, most basic enemy in the FPS genre, usually about the size of a house cat. Sometimes, they have projectiles, sometimes they crawl at you and attempt to melee, and sometimes they explode when they attack, but the basic idea is the same. Typically, they die in a couple shots from the basic pistol, but are fairly common in the early levels and/or interfere with your ability to deal with other enemies

disruptor

Soldier - fighter

Elite

Heavy

Lightning bruiser 

Shield 

Sniper

Trigger

An enemy that must be treated with care otherwise something bad will happen.  
The Trigger is a type of Zombie or Soldier that will, if treated the wrong way, become a much greater threat to the player.

Ninja
An enemy that is fast, stealthy, or agile.
In many ways, the Ninja is the opposite of the Heavy. Instead of being much stronger than the basic Mook, he's much faster - or she is. If there's a female mook, it's often the Ninja. The Ninja has very high movement speed, and is usually also very agile, having moves not available to standard Mooks such as being able to climb walls or make two-story jumps to move up to higher platforms. In extreme cases they can outright teleport. Ninjas usually prefer melee attacks, or are at least limited to light weapons such as pistols or submachine guns. They're often equipped with some form of cloaking device as well. Surprisingly, the Ninja isn't really a Fragile Speedster, and can usually survive at least as much damage as a standard Soldier Mook.
# Gameplay

Primary concern: most creatures have limited access to long range fires. How do they compete?

# equalizing ranged weapons to melee monsters

## Smarter enemies
- positioning
- cover
- concealment
- obscuration
- traps
- ambush
- maneuver
- battlefield
	- Terrain ([[Tactical Procedural Generation]])
	- shaping
	- artifacts
- initiative
- Different victory conditions
- Overwhelming Lanchester's law (# melee monsters = # ranged party ^2)
- capturing, manipulating human tech
 - Thrown weapons (weak melee)
 
## innate capabilities
 - Toughness
 - speed
 - Flyer
 - Combat Mass - the melee creatures need outnumber the enemy force by the square of their numbers
 - extreme performance 


## Projectiles
- Suicide minions
 - Spines
 - Shockwave ( HEAT-like performance )
 - Liquid
 - Chemical
	 - ex: The beetles' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator.[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle#cite_note-7)Â The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-benzoquinone, an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory system of vertebrates.

## How Do You Design a Cast of Enemies?

[How Do You Design a Cast of Enemies?](https://www.youtube.com/@DesignDoc)

"What I like most"
## Novelty over time

1. Each part of the bestiary should be new and exciting
2. The game needs to be able to sustain a degree of novelty over time

## It's a good idea to look from a few different angles
* Visual design
	* Modern shooters have trouble here because its easy for enemy designs to blur together, such as uniforms
		* we can use mechanical behavior
		* compensating with more outlandish concepts (armor, weapons, ridiculous uniforms)
* Mechanics - Behavior, systems
