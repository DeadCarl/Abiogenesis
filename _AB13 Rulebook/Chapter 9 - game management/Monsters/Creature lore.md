Modes of life

Competitive exclusion may be avoided if one or both of the competing species evolves to use a different resource, occupy a different area of the habitat, or feed during a different time of day. The result of this kind of evolution is that two similar species use largely non-overlapping resources and thus have different niches. This is called resource partitioning, and it helps the species coexist because there is less direct competition between them.

The ecological niche describes how a species interacts within an ecosystem. The niche of a species depends on both biotic and abiotic factors, which affect the ability of a species to survive and endure.

Biotic factors affecting a species' niche include food availability and predators. Abiotic factors affecting ecological niche include temperature, landscape characteristics, soil nutrients, light and other non-living factors.

An example of an ecological niche is that of the dung beetle. The dung beetle, as its name suggests, consumes dung both in larval and adult form. Dung beetles store dung balls in burrows, and females lay eggs within them.

This allows hatched larvae immediate access to food. The dung beetle in turn influences the surrounding environment by aerating soil and rereleasing beneficial nutrients. Therefore, the dung beetle performs a unique role in its environment.


Ecologist Charles Elton’s definition of niche focused on the role of a species, such as its trophic role. His tenets emphasized more on community similarity and less on competition.

In 1957, Zoologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson provided a sort of compromise of these trains of thought. Hutchinson described two forms of niche. The fundamental niche focused on the conditions in which a species could exist with no ecological interactions. The realized niche, in contrast, considered the population’s existence in the presence of interactions, or competition.



Competition in a niche either leads each species to specialize in a different way, so as not to use the same resources, or leads one of the competing species to become extinct. This is another way of looking at natural selection. There are two theories used to address competitive exclusion.

In R* Theory, multiple species cannot exist with the same resources unless they differentiate their niches. When resource density is at its lowest, those species populations most limited by the resource will be competitively excluded.

In P* Theory, consumers can exist at high density due to having shared enemies.


Overlapping Niches/Resource Partitioning

Given the fact that organisms cannot exist in a bubble and must therefore naturally interact with other species, occasionally niches can overlap. To avoid competitive exclusion, similar species can change over time to use different resources.

In other cases, they can exist in the same area but use resources at different times. This scenario is called resource partitioning.

Resource partitioning: Partitioning means separating. Simply put, species can use their resources in ways that reduce depletion. This allows the species to coexist and even evolve.



Niche Construction Theory

Ecologists more recently have focused on niche construction theory, which describes how organisms modify their environments to make them better suited as niches. Examples of this include making burrows, building nests, creating shade, building beaver dams and other methods in which organisms alter their surroundings to suit their needs.

Niche construction arose from biologist John Odling-Smee. Odling-Smee argued that niche construction should be considered a process of evolution, a form of “ecological inheritance” passed on to descendents rather than a genetic inheritance.



There are four core principles behind niche construction theory:

    One involves
    non-random modification
    of the environment by a species, helping aid their evolution. 
    Second, the “ecological” inheritance alters evolution due to
    parents passing on the altering skills
    to their offspring.
    Third, new characteristics that are
    adopted
    become evolutionarily significant. The environments are affected systematically. 
    Fourth, what was considered adaptation is essentially the result of organisms making their environments more complementary via
    niche construction
    .

**1. Non-Sapient**, INT 1-5 in my 5e indexing, features “cognition, sensation, emotion”.  
**2. Sapient**, INT 6-19 in my 5e indexing, features “self awareness, language, rationality, abstractness, numeracy”.  
**3. Transapient**, INT 20-29 in my 5e indexing, features “foresight, oversight, ideogenesis, translogic, autoscience”

## Traits
The Reflex System uses both values and ratings to define a character's traits and abilities. A value is always numeric (e.g. 8), while a rating is always defined by a quantity of dice (e.g. 3d20).
### feral
Feral life such as terrestrial animals are rated on one attribute, cunning. Cunning measures feral intelligence and reasoning.

Most feral creatures do not possess skill ratings, but instead possess unique attribute ratings.
### Intelligent 
Intelligent, sapient life is rated on a quartet of mental attributes; cognition, education, Personality and resolve.

Intelligent NPC life possess a set of key skill ratings that define their role. Additionally, they possess a competence rating that represents their skills in everything irrelevant to their key skills.

Most human life has an attribute rating of 2L. Nonhuman intelligent life may possess unique attribute ratings like unintelligent life.

sentience score

Sapience score, Sapience quotient - a conjectural value comparing a given creature to a human with the value unity, and to bare sentience at 0. Values above unity are said to be superhuman levels of sapience.

> Chaos is inherently universal as I have touched upon previously in my article about [Mr. Freeze’s Freezing Gun](https://cosmicchemist.com/2016/08/14/mr-freezes-freeze-gun/). In accordance with the 2nd law of thermodynamics, a closed system’s entropy (a statistical representation of the universal inclination towards chaos) can never decrease but only increase or remain constant. The Universe prefers chaos over order. If one were to fully characterize the Universe in the dramaturgical sense with humanity, or just living beings, as the protagonists, the Universe is certainly our antagonist. It stands staunchly against the very fabric of our being. The immense and extravagant complexities of life are a slap in the Universe’s face if you will.
