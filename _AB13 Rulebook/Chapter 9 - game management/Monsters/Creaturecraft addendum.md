Carry

A Carry is the hero that the team rallies around in the late game. The role's name is derived from the act of "carrying" a team, which is to bear the responsibility of leading the team to victory. The carry is expected to have the largest contribution to the team, and is critical in winning team fights.

Nuker

Nukers are heroes with abilities that deliver high burst damage throughout the game. Their goal is to give the team an advantage by killing enemy heroes before they can react to team fights.

Initiator

Initiators are heroes who can safely start a team fight. These heroes typically have a strong area of effect or special skill to affect the positioning of the enemy team.

Disabler

Disablers are heroes with abilities more focused on reliable crowd control, either by single target or area of effect. They can act as initiators in small skirmishes, or as support by holding the enemy down for the carry to finish off.

Durable

Durable heroes are capable of sustaining large amounts of incoming damage. They tend to have high HP, HP regeneration, healing, magic resistance, or status resistance. They often have abilities to mitigate damage, avoid damage completely, or weaken the power of enemies.

Escape

Escape heroes are equipped with one or more escape mechanisms which allow them (and sometimes their allies) to avoid damage while retreating or repositioning themselves during a team fight

Supports

Supports are heroes who keep their allies alive and give them opportunities to earn more gold and experience. Supports will usually come with skills such as healing spells or disables, and generally have low damage output but a powerful (yet situational) nuke

Pusher

Pushers focus on bringing down towers quickly, thereby acquiring map control. If they succeed, they often shut down the enemy carry by forcing them away from farming.
