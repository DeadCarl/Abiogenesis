# [Experiencing space](https://www.lbrarchitecture.co.uk/how-we-experience-spaces/)

Space is the negative, open volume between positive elements.

Space is seen only through its defined boundaries

People describe space according to movement.

The function of a space dictates the nature of movement
	- a narrow corridor will facilitate movement through but limits encouragement to linger
	- large halls offer much more variation in movement or stasis
	- changes of movement affect experience: moving from Small to large can inspire sensations of awe or freedom; large to small can be comforting or threatening

Designing spaces is complex. 'it is impossible to predict everything about a space before it is built.'

# [Terrain placement is a tool](https://bloodandspectacles.blogspot.com/2020/04/wargame-design-terrain-placement-is-tool.html)

>  For example, I have been rethinking how **[Movement](https://bloodandspectacles.blogspot.com/2018/04/wargame-design-movement-can-be-cool.html)** can be more innovative, how to create [**tactical game play**](https://bloodandspectacles.blogspot.com/2018/07/wargame-design-creating-tactical-game.html), and building [**balance**](https://bloodandspectacles.blogspot.com/2019/08/wargame-design-trying-to-create-balance.html) into your games.

> An area that very rarely gets looked at our discussed is board set-up and creation.

> Terrain is an X factor that helps make games much deeper and more interesting ... change where and how interactions occur

>   Good board lay out can do the following to enhance game play:

- ·       Help balance a scenario
- ·       Add thematic elements
- ·       Restrict or shape movement
- ·       Provide tactical options
- ·       Force decision making on the player
## Approaches to terrain placement

### Follow the map
Players are given a specific scenario and a map.  They are then supposed to lay out the board matching the map.

- **Advantage:** The designer can use the map to “balance” the scenario with a known terrain configuration.  In addition, it can be used to match an actual **[historical scenario](https://bloodandspectacles.blogspot.com/2019/05/wargame-design-designing-historical.html)**. 
- **Disadvantage:** The Players need the right shape and type of terrain to play.  In historicals, the scenario is often decided and the terrain made to fit before the game.  That is not true for more pick-up and casual play games.  There gamers tend to use what they have.

### One player sets
one player (often the host) gets to set-up the terrain anyway they want.

Then the other player arrives and chooses the side to deploy on and/or the force they are using.  This is a method that I use frequently in my home games.

- **Advantage:** Quick and easy.  It allows you to get to playing quickly.  Often, a player builds the game to a theme and lays out terrain accordingly with this method  
- **Disadvantage:** The terrain is laid out purely at the players whim, often with no input from the opponent.  Not ideal for a casual or pick-up game.

### Randomized terrain

the game typically has some sort of terrain chart that is rolled on to generate a specific piece of terrain.  Placement can also be randomized using a scatter chart method or sections of the board. 

- **Advantages:** No player has definitive control over the terrain placement.  Where it goes and what it is is determined by an element of chance. 

- **Disadvantage:** Boards can be disorganized and look randomized.  Players may not have the specific terrain being called for.

### Alternate Placement
The players have a certain number of terrain pieces that they can place.

- **Advantage:** Players take a role in placing terrain, which allows some tactical or game play opportunity in the set-up phase.
- **Disadvantage:** This can lead to terrain hampering game play.  Players can either place it all where it does not matter, or in the direct center of the board.  The board may look unfocused.

### Fill the grid

The board is divided into an arbitrary number of grid squares that all must have at least one piece of terrain in the grid space.      

- Advantage: The terrain is placed “evenly” around the board.
- Disadvantage: This can lead to a very “symmetrical” placement that no longer looks natural.

## Extra

I like how Triumph! (a modern take on DBA) has semi-randomized terrain. Players choose terrain based on where the battle is taking place, which depends on the strategic and tactical aggressiveness of the armies. Players then assign numbers to the terrain pieces, and a randomized map is chosen either by drawing a card or rolling dice (I think there's 36 results). These maps also account for water terrain and roads.

# [Using topographical maps in miniature wargaming](https://sapperjoeswargamingtoys.blogspot.com/2012/09/using-topographical-maps-in-miniature.html)
Adapted from Sapper Joe

Terrain in wargames generally lack in the necessary detail to simulate the challenge of real world conditions

> This problem of lack of terrain features confuses some players as they have a visual understanding of what they see vs. an abstract understanding of what the terrain on the table really represents.  A perfect example of this is if one was to game the Battle of the Cowpens, in South Carolina, 1781.  If you look at most maps in books or gaming magazines you see a flat, featureless plain without any trees in the main area of engagement.  Most gamers would not or cannot understand how the British commanders failed to see the Continental regulars who were standing in full open view at the opposite end of the battlefield and marched themselves into a trap.  I had the fortune of visiting the battlefield and seeing that even with the most gentle of slopes how the British could not see the Continental line.  Some systems, like Too Fat Lardies, have blinds and spotting rules, but to most gamers, they can’t wrap their heads around the idea of a unit been hidden in plain view.  That is where having access to topographical maps can help.

> Anyone who has served in the armed forces should be familiar with topographical (topo) maps, and basics of map reading.  While there are various map scales out there, the US Army mainly uses the 1:25,000 and the 1:50,000 scale maps for land navigation, while aviation used different scaled maps.  Because I am an ex-Army ground pounder, I am still comfortable around these maps.  I realized that if I was to do a game board based off of a topo map that it would be very consuming of resources (limited use, money for material, time consuming to make, storage space, etc.)  But these maps can be very useful for understanding the need for more terrain on the board, whether it would be trees, hills, etc.

Generating maps from topo maps is itself time consuming

Basing maps on topography is a simplification that can capture the feel of an area

> In Charlie Don’t Surf, the ground scale is 12”=100 yds (300’), or 1:300 scale.  This actually means micro-armor miniatures are very close to being in scale to the game’s ground scale.  But to keep things simple for my math conversions when I am scaling the 1:50000 topo map to the game board, I am changing the ground scale just slightly by making 12”=100m, or 1:328 scale.  That means that a one square grid on a 1:50000 map will take up a 10’ x 10’ table.  But my biggest gaming table will be 6’ x 4’, which means a 0.6 x 0.4 square grid area, or a 0.37 x 0.25 square mile area. 
> 
> As for the contour lines, a 20m (65.6’) contour will be 2.4” hill and a 10m (32.8’) contour would be 1.2” hill.  I will round both of those up to 2-1/2” and 1-1/4” rises in the terrain respectfully.  When you consider that the M48A3 tank was just over 10’ (3m) tall, using the 10m contour lines for the next level of elevation makes sense in gaming. In the term of using my 10mm miniatures instead of the more closer scale of 1:285/300 or 6mm,  my figures are about twice as tall as they should be compared to the ground scale, but that really does not bother me.

I share your love of maps Joe. Certainly at Goose Green, the use of dead ground (even small folds in the Darwin Ridge feature) could literally mean the difference between life and death! Great approach. All good things, Rusty.

A great article. "Real life" terrain is incredibly dense. Take a "flat" field with a mere 3' depression in the middle. Throw a 3' crop on top of that and you can hide a whole platoon or more in there. And let's not get into setting up your SAW team in the drainage ditch or behind the access road.
