Tyrants are a monster type characterized by a seemingly unstoppable durability or relentless pursuit.

Typically, tyrant types have a high coverage of effective small arms resistance - ordinary wounds just don't hurt them - and require light weapons or greater to engage conventionally.

The stuff of slasher horror movies, the tyrant takes its name from the bioweapons of resident evil. Examples include mr x, the thing, leatherface from texas chainsaw massacre, and so on.
