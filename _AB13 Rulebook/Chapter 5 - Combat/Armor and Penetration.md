# armor
Subtract the armor value from the total damage value. If the result is zero or less, the attack fails.

# Penetration
Penetration reduces the effective armor value. Overpenetration adds no additional damage

~~Penetration: The base Penetration value of any attack made with the weapon. Non-explosive ranged weapons have two Penetration values.  The first is for attacks made at optimum range or closer, and the second is for attacks made past optimum range.  This trait is not listed for explosives - see the explosion rules in Chapter Five for details.~~
## Stage III Candidate: Overpenetration
Penetration in excess of armor reduces the final damage total.
