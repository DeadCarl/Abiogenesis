# Injury Decks
## By Effect
### Blood
lose [severity] trauma per round.
### Stun
lose [severity] ticks
### Pain
lose [severity] dice for the exchange of fire.
### Structural trauma
multiply damage by [severity]

tasks that use the affected region gain a penalty equal to [severity].

Special:
- Leg criticals reduce movement by [severity] \* 2.
- Head criticals penalize all actions by [severity].

## Generic Structural effects
### Venous
The character loses an amount of trauma equal to the [severity] per round.
### musculoskeletal, nervous
Character receives a penalty of [severity] \* 2 to actions requiring that muscle or bone. If the penalty drops the odds of success below 0, the limb is useless.
### Organs
multiply damage by [severity].
## real life examples
 GMs are recommended to not use these examples regularly - they are primarily for illustrative purposes.

## Severity

Abbreviated Injury Score-Code is on a scale of one to six, one being a minor injury and six being maximal (currently untreatable).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviated_Injury_Scale#cite_note-AIS2008-1) An AIS-Code of 6 is not the arbitrary code for a deceased patient or fatal injury, but the code for injuries specifically assigned an AIS 6 severity.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviated_Injury_Scale#cite_note-AIS2008-1) An AIS-Code of 9 is used to describe injuries for which not enough information is available for more detailed coding, e.g. crush injury to the [head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_head "Human head").

The AIS scale is a measurement tool for single injuries. A universally accepted injury aggregation function has not yet been proposed, though the [injury severity score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_severity_score "Injury severity score") and its derivatives are better aggregators for use in clinical settings.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviated_Injury_Scale#cite_note-AIS2008-1)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviated_Injury_Scale#cite_note-manual-5) In other settings such as automotive design and occupant protection, MAIS is a useful tool for the comparison of specific injuries and their relative severity and the changes in those frequencies that may result from evolving motor vehicle design.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviated_Injury_Scale#cite_note-AIS2008-1)
