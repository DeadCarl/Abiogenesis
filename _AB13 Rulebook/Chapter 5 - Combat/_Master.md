# survival psychology and physiology

 The Reflex System’s combat rules  attempt to replicate this imprecision, uncertainty, and immediacy, hopefully while providing enough detail to satisfy most players.

 Before addressing these rules, however, it’s worth taking a little time to discuss the effect of combat on a character who experiences.
 
In the modern world, very few individuals have a natural aptitude for survival.
The human mind works by constantly creating internal models of the way it believes the world to be, based on a lifetime’s cumulative experience.
Situations experienced more often provide more data, which allows more accurate mental models.
In turn, this enables the mind to more accurately predict upcoming events and decide on appropriate actions in familiar circumstances.
The problem with sudden, unexpected events is that the mind is unprepared for them due to a lack of prior experience.
  This causes its mental models to break down.
This difference between expectation and reality gets people killed on a daily basis because they can’t decide how to react to sudden threats, whether they come in the form of hurricanes, earthquakes, traffic hazards, or angry men with guns.
 
 In addition to the set of problems that an unprepared mind can cause in combat, the human body has its own set of survival imperatives.
Despite being tool-using omnivores with millennia of experience in killing each other, we still see ourselves as prey on some primal level.
The conspiracy of our bodies and our subconscious minds dictates certain behavior in the face of lethal danger: freeze to avoid notice, flee if chased, and fight inelegantly and brutally if cornered.
“Fight or flight” is an oversimplification of this glandular and subconscious set of responses, but it’s not inaccurate.
 
 When something triggers the physiological set of threat responses, the body takes steps to prepare itself for immediate physical exertion and trauma.
Glands dump hormones into the bloodstream to enhance strength and speed.
Capillaries in the extremities constrict, forcing blood out of the arms and legs to prevent excessive blood loss from trauma.

This preparation comes with a price, however.
Hormones interfere with rational decision- making ability, and lowered blood supply to the extremities means loss of fine motor control.
As if that weren’t enough, the parts of the brain that handle sensory input often block out information that isn’t relevant to the immediate threat.
Tunnel vision, temporary deafness, and complete obliviousness to pain are all normal experiences.
 
 This narrowing of perception and focusing of capability tends to distort overall awareness of the environment in a survival situation.
Time perception is wholly unreliable – a firefight can be over before a combatant has a chance to consciously realize that he’s fighting for his life, or can seem to play out in excruciating slow-motion.
Memory is rarely reliable when it comes to precise details or sequences of events.
 
 All of these factors combine to make combat a confusing and chaotic environment for anyone involved in it.

The Reflex System represents this by emphasizing events as the characters perceive them, rather than focusing primarily on numerical factors like precise time and distance that are obvious only to outside observers (players and GMs). [[kairological versus chronological time]]

# the combat attributes 
 The eight core attributes model a character’s innate qualities under normal circumstances.
However, as noted above, the ability to act quickly and decisively in the face of an immediate lethal threat isn’t common to all people.
Some studies indicate that no more than 10% of the human population is psychologically capable of maintaining full function in such a situation.
In the world of Twilight: 2013, a large potion of the other 90% is already dead, but this doesn’t automatically indicate that every survivor is a natural- born killer.
The two “combat psychology” attributes, Coolness Under Fire (CUF) and Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA), model a character’s psychological and physiological capacity for decision and action in combat.

## Coolness Under Fire 
Coolness Under Fire is a game mechanic representing a character’s capacity to override his basic mammalian survival instincts.
This comes from a combination of trained reflex, self- control, and willingness to accept injury as a consequence of action.
 To a certain extent, CUF can be considered a “courage attribute,” though it only addresses the limited subset of courage in the face of immediate physical danger (moral rectitude and similar forms of courage are roleplaying decisions or functions of Resolve).
 
 Some events or environmental conditions can make it highly desirable for a combatant to do nothing more than seek cover and try to remain unnoticed.
No one wants to stare into a mushroom cloud as it boils skyward over his head or charge uphill into automatic weapons fire.
That sort of thing tends to engage the “freeze” and “flee” responses discussed earlier.
CUF enables a character to act, and to continue acting, when confronted with such threats, despite the perfectly reasonable desire to get the hell out of the fight.
A higher CUF value enables a character to override his survival responses and keep going in the face of more extreme or immediate threats.

## Observe-Orient-Decide-Act 
The Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop was first described by Colonel John Boyd, a 
 Air Force military strategist.
Boyd theorized the OODA loop as a model for the decision-making process that all organisms (and organizations) use, composed of four interrelated cycles: • Observe: Receive direct sensory information about a situation (“Some guys wearing civilian clothes and carrying assault rifles are standing over there.”).
 •Orient: Match incoming information with known facts to ascertain what’s happening (“AK-47s and no uniforms means they’re probably enemy irregular forces.”).
 •Decide: Select or create an appropriate response to the situation (“Eliminate the threat before they can eliminate me.
 I need to take cover and open fire.”).
 • Act: Execute the response and observe the result, continuing the loop (Bang!).
 
 Although Boyd originally described the OODA loop as a training tool for fighter pilots, it’s not unique to combat.
Anyone reading this book goes through OODA loops thousands of times a day in response to normal circumstances.
Driving is an excellent example: every driver observes the action of other vehicles and the environment, draws conclusions about the flow of traffic, decides which control inputs to give his vehicle, and acts accordingly.
A novice driver is still working through parts of his OODA loops consciously – he has to think for a moment about how to work the clutch or whether his speed is appropriate.
A driver who’s distracted by a conversation on a cellular phone doesn’t process his driving-related OODA loops as quickly because he’s diverting part of his mental capacity to other OODA loops (the ones related to conversation or the use of the phone’s controls).
 
 Experience with any given situation allows an individual to cycle through his OODA loop faster when dealing with that situation.
Combat is no different, and for the vast majority of people, it’s an unfamiliar environment, with literally hundreds of new sensory inputs that have to be analyzed.
 Like a novice driver, a novice combatant has to devote conscious thought to each action, while a veteran can orient on familiar observations and react to them without having to stop to figure out what they mean.
The OODA attribute represents a character’s mental reflex speed in combat, and provides a relative measurement of his capacity for a rapid OODA loop.
A higher OODA value enables a character to act more swiftly and to recognize and adapt to unexpected changes in a combat situation.
 
# the flow of combat 
The ebb and flow of battle rarely generates a constant, sustained barrage of fire.
Instead, brief bursts of intense activity punctuate stressful and ominous silences.
The Reflex System represents this fluctuation with exchanges of fire and pauses.
 The actions that a character can take during combat are divided into two categories.
 Tactical actions are simple and swift, requiring no more than a few seconds to execute.
They occur during exchanges of fire.
Operational actions are more complex, requiring up to a minute to perform, and usually occur during pauses.
Individual tactical and operational actions are described on pages 139 and 141, respectively.
## starting combat 
Starting a fight is easy: hit somebody.

 To be less flippant, combat begins when any participant initiates a physical action to which any other participant wants to respond immediately.
This doesn’t have to be combat in the most literal sense of lethal attacks occurring.
If two characters are racing to grab the last piece of fried chicken from a picnic bench a few meters away, resolution of the conflicting physical efforts can occur in combat time.
Conversely, an attack doesn’t automatically initiate combat.
If one character punches another in the face, but the victim doesn’t respond and all the witnesses just stand around watching, that’s not combat.
As the saying goes, it takes two to tango.

 Combat always begins with an exchange of fire, never with a pause.

## exchanges of fire
At the beginning of an exchange of fire, every participant in the combat receives a base initiative value determined by his current encumbrance (see p. 206 for rules on determining a character’s encumbrance level): 

Encumbrance  Table 5a: Encuberance Initiative Modifiers

Then make an OODA check (the initiative check).
If the check fails, the character’s base initiative doesn’t change.
If it succeeds, add twice the margin of success to his base initiative value.
The result is the character’s starting initiative value – the tick on which he begins his first action.

 Once initiative is determined, the exchange of fire starts on the tick equal to the highest initiative of any participant.
As all characters execute actions, the current tick counts down toward zero.
The exchange of fire ends after the end of Tick 1.
 
 Example: Ed is in the middle of the day’s march when his team comes under attack.
He has OODA 8 and, at the beginning of combat, is heavily encumbered.
He succeeds at his OODA check with a margin of success of 6.
He’ll begin acting on Tick 19 (his base initiative of 7 for heavy encumbrance, plus twice his MoS).
 
 Ed has the highest starting initiative of anyone involved in the combat, so the exchange of fire begins on Tick 19, when he begins his first action.
During the first exchange of fire, Ed ditches his pack and other extraneous gear, bringing his encumbrance level down to moderate.
 
 At the beginning of the second exchange of fire, Ed fails his OODA check.
He’ll begin acting on Tick 9 (his base initiative for moder- ate encumbrance).
 
## Performing Tactical Actions
Every tactical action has a tick cost.
 This is the number of ticks required for a character to perform it.
A character may perform a tactical action on the tick equal to his current initiative.
When this occurs, subtract the action’s tick cost from the character’s current initiative value.
A character may not take an action whose tick cost would reduce his initiative below zero, except for the Wait action.
 
 Example: Ed’s starting initiative value is 19, so his first action occurs on Tick 19.
He attacks with the weapon that’s already in his hands.
 This action has a tick cost of 5.
 Ed’s initiative becomes (19 – 5 =) 14, so his next action will occur on Tick 14.

 Multiple characters will often have the opportunity to act on the same tick.
For the purposes of timing and preemption, all actions that occur on the same tick are assumed to occur and take effect simultaneously.
 This means that if two characters fire at each other on the same tick and both attacks succeed, both characters are hit at the same instant.
## Ending an Exchange of Fire
At the end of an exchange of fire, all participants in the combat have the option to press or hold.
If all involved parties choose to hold, a pause begins.
If any participant chooses to press, a new exchange of fire begins immediately.
Every combatant who presses at the end of an exchange of fire increases his base initiative value in the next exchange of fire by 5.

Remember that a character who is broken (see p. 159) must hold.
His self-preservation drive prevents him from pressing for continued hostilities.

# pauses
A pause is a lull in combat when no one is making attacks.
 This isn’t to say that combat is over, just that bullets aren’t flying at that particular moment.
During a pause, each character may perform one operational action.
Operational actions are declared and resolved in descending order of CUF (i.
e.
 the character with the highest CUF goes first).

## Ending a Pause
After every character’s operational action is resolved, each participant must again choose whether to press or hold, with the same effects as previously described.
However, having an enemy just a few meters away is stressful, and someone’s nerve will break eventually.
Any combatant who chooses to hold must succeed in a CUF check with a penalty equal to the number of pauses that have occurred since the last exchange of fire.
If he fails this check, his “hold” choice becomes “press,” and he does not receive the normal bonus to initiative for pressing.
## ending combat 
Combat ends when only one side has participants in the fight who are capable of continuing combat and willing to do so.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone else is dead.
It’s possible for participants in a fight to bug out, leaving the field to the other side (see p. 142 for the Withdraw operational action).
Characters can also refuse to make initiative rolls.
A combatant who takes this action has effectively surrendered.
He must remain inactive during the subsequent exchange of fire, having left himself at the mercy of his opponents.

# tactical actions
Tactical actions are those that a character takes while he’s in the thick of the fight and bullets are flying.
Most tactical actions occur according to a character’s trained reflexes.
 They are relatively simple physical motions intended to either maintain his fighting capability or neutralize his opponents.
Few tactical actions last longer than a couple of seconds of objective time.

 Activate/Deactivate Equipment Many pieces of equipment are too complex for instant use in the middle of a gunfight, but items with simple on/off switches can be activated or deactivated.
 Tick Cost: 1 tick.
 
 Assess A character may pause to take a look around the battlefield and make detailed observations.
This allows the player to make an Awareness check to notice significant details about the current situation or to retry a previously-failed Awareness check (for example, to locate a camouflaged sniper).
 Tick Cost: Minimum of 1 tick.
The player may voluntarily add up to 5 additional ticks to this cost.
Each additional tick provides a cumulative +1 bonus to the Awareness check.
 
 Attack An attack is the archetypal tactical action, and the one that is likely to be most commonly seen in combat scenes.
 Each weapon, including the unaugmented human body, is capable of three types of attacks (see p. 142).
 Tick Cost: As per the weapon and attack type used.
 
 Block A block is a defensive action unique to close combat (see p.
 149 for rules on deflecting attacks with this action).
 Tick Cost: 1 tick plus the Blind Strike Speed of the weapon used for the block.
 
 Change Stance For game purposes, a character can be in one of four basic stances: standing, kneeling, sitting, or prone.
Each of these stances has certain effects, as described in the Stances sidebar.
 Tick Cost: 2 ticks to assume a lower stance (standing to kneeling/sitting, or kneeling/sitting to prone).
4 ticks to assume a higher stance (prone to kneeling/sitting, or kneeling/sitting to standing).
 
 Communicate (Simple) A gunfight isn’t the right place for a soliloquy or dialogue.
 Characters don’t have the freedom to converse when the bullets are flying – remember, one exchange of fire lasts only a few seconds.
 A character can get out a simple message such as “Watch the door!” or “Get your hands up!” but that’s about it.
More complex communication must wait for a pause.
 Tick Cost: 1 tick for a single syllable (“Stop!”), 3 ticks for a short phrase (“Drop the weapon!”), or 5 ticks for a moderately eloquent sentence (“Get on the ground now or I will shoot you in the face!”).
If the communication requires the character to use a devices controls (i.
e.
 press a “transmit” button on a radio), add 1 tick.
 
 Ditch Item A character holding something may want to free his hands for other tasks, or he may suddenly need to divest himself of a piece of equipment that’s become dangerous.
A character who ditches an item removes it from his person and lets it fall within Personal range of himself.
No task check is normally required to ditch an item.
Under extenuating circumstances such as drowning or being on fire, the GM may require a Coordination check.
 
 A character also can ditch an article of clothing (including body armor), a backpack, or a set of load-bearing equipment.
 However, all of these items are secured to his body by design, so removal in a matter of seconds tends to occur with panicked brute force – the typical reaction to, say, finding one’s pants on fire.
A character ditching a garment, backpack, or set of load-bearing equipment (LBE) has a flat 50% chance of damaging it in the process.
Military-issue backpacks and LBE usually include quick- release buckles which allow rapid removal without this hazard.
 Tick Cost: If the character is holding the item, this action has a tick cost of 0 – no appreciable time is required to just open a hand and let gravity take over.
If the item is connected to the character, this action requires half the time normally required to ready it.
 Ditching a garment, backpack, or LBE takes the remainder of the exchange of fire (3 ticks for quick-release buckles).
 
 Move Unless a character is behind cover, staying stationary is a good way to die.
Movement as a tactical action is covered in detail in the following Tactical Movement section.
 Tick Cost: 5 ticks.
 
 Ready/Stow Item A character must have a weapon or other item in his hands and properly configured before he can use it.
A character can only ready an item that is immediately accessible on his body or within Personal range.
No task check is required to ready an item unless its related rules specifically call for one.
Stowing is the exact opposite of readying: returning an item to on-body or nearby storage.
 Tick Cost: Equal to the item’s Bulk (minimum 1).
If the item is in a closed or secured container, such as a zippered pocket or a holster with a retention strap, add 1 tick.
If the character has to extract item from a cluttered or tightly-packed container, add 1d10 ticks.
If the character is attempting to ready or stow a two-handed item with only one hand, double the total tick cost.
 If the item is a weapon and the character has an Unskilled rating with the skill relevant to its use, all Ready/Stow Item actions have twice the normal tick cost.
 
 Reload Many fights will last long enough for characters to empty their guns.
Reloading replenishes a weapon’s ammunition supply.
 If the weapon in question is fed from a detachable magazine, one action completely reloads it, locking in a new magazine.
If it’s fed from an internal magazine or cylinder, reloading loads 3 rounds of ammo.

Support weapons take a little longer to reload.
If a weapon is belt-fed, two actions are required to reload it.
If it’s a heavy weapon, two actions load 1 round of ammo.
 Tick Cost: Equal to the weapon’s Bulk (minimum 1).
If the character has to dig the fresh ammo out of deep storage such as the bottom of a backpack, add time as if he were readying it (see previous).
If the character is “topping off” – ejecting a partially- empty magazine or belt and replacing it with a full one – and wants to retain the partial load for later use rather than just dropping it, add 2 ticks.
 If the character has an Unskilled rating with the skill relevant to the weapon’s use, all Reload actions have three times the normal tick cost.

Wait A character doesn’t have to act on every tick.
The “wait” action is a mechanism to enable a character to delay for a moment before doing something else.
Note that this action is deliberately designed to prevent most characters from waiting one tick at a time so as to have improbably low response times to unexpected events.
 Characters with slow OODA loops take a few more fractions of a second to catch up with changes in the tactical situation.
 Tick Cost: Dependent on the character’s OODA value: OODA
 
Table 5b: OODA Cost

# [[tactical movement]]
Movement during an exchange of fire is considered an action, and each Move action always has a tick cost of 5 ticks.
However, tactical movement is not exclusive.
Whenever a player declares that his character is taking a Move action, he may also declare another tactical action with a tick cost of 5 or less that the character will execute during that movement. This second action is declared on the same tick as the character’s Move action and is resolved normally. A character cannot change stance while moving, but any other action is valid, subject to the GM’s discretion.

Characters may move at various speeds, depending on their physical condition.
The following movement rates, listed from fastest to slowest, each have their own restrictions and their own effects on the character’s ability to act while using them.
The distance a character moves at a given speed is dependent on his physical attributes, as per the character creation rules (see p.94).

 • Sprint: A sprinting character must be unencumbered and may not have any leg injuries.
A sprinting character suffers a –5 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control (for game purposes, ranged attacks require fine motor control, as do most other Coordination-based actions, but close combat attacks do not).
However, his speed inflicts a –3 penalty to all ranged attacks made against him.
 
 •Run: A character may run so long as he has no leg injury worse than slight and is not more than lightly encumbered.
A running character suffers a –3 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control.
However, his speed inflicts a –2 penalty to all ranged attacks made against him.
 
 •Trot: A character may trot if he has no leg injury worse than slight and is not more than moderately encumbered (combat loaded).
A trotting character suffers a –2 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control.
However, his speed inflicts a –1 penalty to all ranged attacks made against him.
 
 •Walk: A character with a moderate leg injury or heavy encumbrance is limited to walking speed.
A walking character suffers a –1 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control.
 
 •Stagger: A character with a serious leg injury, one who is kneeling, or one who is overloaded is limited to staggering.
 A staggering character suffers a –1 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control.

 •Crawl: The last resort of those who must move or die but who cannot stand up – or those who need to stay low to avoid hazards.
A prone character or one with a critical leg injury may only crawl.
When crawling, a character suffers a –4 penalty on any action requiring fine motor control.

In addition to covering distance, a character may also use the Move action to enter or exit a vehicle or to mount or dismount from an animal.
One Move action is required to mount or dismount a motorcycle or similar open vehicle or to dismount from an animal.
 Two Move actions allow the character to enter or exit a normal passenger or cargo vehicle or to mount an animal.
Three move actions are required to enter or exit a combat vehicle or other conveyance with limited access.

# operational actions
Operational actions are those that a character takes to prepare for the next set of tactical actions in one way or another.
 These can also be considered “support actions,” as they contribute indirectly, rather than directly, to a favorable outcome of the combat.
Each operational action lasts between 20 and 60 seconds.
 In other words, an operational action lasts as long as the pause in which it occurs.

In the case of all operational actions, common sense should dictate the limits of what a character can accomplish in less than a minute.
Literal interpretation of the following rules may be subject to abuse from unscrupulous or clueless players.
The GM is fully within his rights to prevent a character from reloading 16 separate handguns with a single Reset Weapons action, even if he technically can carry all of them at once.

Communicate (Complex) 
Common sense dictates that characters can engage in casual chatter while performing other operational actions.
This action represents dialogue that requires a character’s full attention, as well as any interaction that requires a social skill check.
Yelling across the street to negotiate with the enemy commander, making a radio call for an air strike, and issuing team orders (see p. 132) are all examples of complex communication.

Don/Doff Clothing Removing clothing with extreme haste falls under the Ditch Item tactical action.
Doing so with more care takes a bit more time, as does getting dressed.
A single Don/Doff Clothing action allows a character to put on or remove one of the following: 
•backpack 
•body armor
•complete set of cold-weather outerwear
•complete set of normal clothing (pants, shirt, footwear, gloves)
•load-bearing equipment (LBE) Putting on miscellaneous accessories such as eye protection, a hat or helmet, a wristwatch, or a wedding ring is incidental to this action.
 
 Field Repair If a piece of equipment or a vehicle system is disabled (p. 154 and p. 279, respectively), a character with direct physical access to it may attempt emergency repairs.
This requires an appropriate skill check – usually Mechanics or Electronics.
As with all efforts to enact repairs, this check suffers a penalty equal to the item’s or vehicle’s current Wear value.
If the action succeeds, the item or system regains working condition for a number of exchanges of fire and pauses equal to the margin of success (minimum 1).
After this time expires, the temporary repairs fail and the device reverts to disabled status.

Keep Watch Simply holding position and keeping an eye on the enemy can be invaluable.
If a character chooses to keep watch during the pause, the player may make an Awareness check to determine what the other side is doing during the pause.
Success makes the character aware of the actions of one or more enemies whose actions are taking place within the character’s line of sight, at the GM’s discretion.
In addition, this Awareness check opposes any Set Hasty Ambush or Withdraw actions that opponents attempt during the pause.

 Render Aid As a single operational action, a character may make one attempt to stabilize a wounded character who’s bleeding out or resuscitate one who’s just died (see p. 173 for rules on medical procedures).
 
 Reset Weapons A character who tends to his weapons during a pause has time to do a bit more than a hasty magazine change.
This action allows a character to fully reload all of his personal weapons and, if necessary, a single crew-served weapon that he’s helping to manage.
In addition, the character clears any jams, misfeeds, or other malfunctions that don’t actually require repair work, and returns items to holsters or sheaths as desired.
 
 Set Hasty Ambush While total surprise is impossible during a pause — after all, the enemy knows that there’s a fight going on — it is possible for a character to conceal his intentions enough to throw off an opponent’s expectations.
 This requires a Tactics (AWA) skill check.
 With success, the character receives a bonus on his next initiative check equal to the margin of success (minimum bonus +1), if the current pause is immediately followed by an exchange of fire.
 If an opponent performs a Keep Watch action during the same pause that a character performs a Set Hasty Ambush action, the result of the opponent’s Awareness check opposes the result of this Tactics check.
If multiple opponents are Keeping Watch, the best Awareness check result is applied.

Use Equipment This operational action is a catch-all for the performance of mechanical or electronic tasks that are simple enough to accomplish in a minute or less.
In many cases, a task check is required for success, depending on the precise action.
Picking a lock, changing a circuit board, hot-wiring a truck, extinguishing a small fire, taking a navigational reading, and copying a computer database are all examples of things a character might need to do during a pause.
This action also encompasses weapon-related actions that aren’t technically attacks, such as setting up a tripod- mounted machine gun or emplacing a demolition charge.

Withdraw A character who simply wants to leave the fight may attempt to disengage, preferably under cover.
This requires either a Fieldcraft (AWA) or Streetcraft (AWA) skill check, depending on whether the combat is occurring in a wilderness area or a settled area.
In addition, the character must be able to move at walking speed or faster (characters limited to staggering or crawling cannot withdraw).
With success, the character gets away cleanly and is no longer involved in the combat.
With failure, the enemy has the option of initiating pursuit.

If an opponent performs a Keep Watch action during the same pause that a character performs a Withdraw action, the result of the opponent’s Awareness check opposes the result of this Tactics check.
If multiple opponents are Keeping Watch, the best Fieldcraft/Streetcraft check result is applied.

## operational actions in place of tactical actions 
Sometimes, a character can’t wait for the bullets to stop flying before applying first aid to a fallen friend or calling for extraction.
 At the GM’s discretion, if a character is in a relatively safe position (typically behind some form of hard cover) and is not panicked at the beginning of an exchange of fire, the player may give up his initiative roll.
Instead of tactical actions, the character takes a single operational action, which is declared at the beginning of the exchange of fire and resolved at the end of it.
 If the character suffers any injury or becomes panicked at any point during the exchange of fire, he fails to complete the operational action.
Any skill check necessary for the operational action suffers a –3 penalty.

## movement during pauses
A character may move at any speed up to his best possible one during a pause.
This is a “free” effect, not an operational action.
 Assume that the total amount of distance a character can cover is equal to 10 times the amount of distance he can cover with a Move tactical action at the equivalent rate (e.g.
 a walking character covers up to 40 meters during a pause).

Movement during a pause does not inflict a penalty on other actions.
It is assumed that the character has time to complete his movement before beginning his operational action.

# attacks 
The Reflex System defines two basic types of attacks: ranged attacks and close combat attacks.
Each of these attack types is detailed in its own subsection (see p. 145 and p. 149, respectively).
 This section addresses the basic rules governing all attacks.
 
## making an attack
To make an attack, a character uses the Attack tactical action.
Both ranged and close combat attacks have three different variations which balance speed and accuracy in different ways.
 Every attack is made with the skill appropriate to the weapon in use (with the exception of throwing, which is a basic human athletic capability).
The three types of attacks are: 

### Blind Strikes and Hip Shots
A blind strike is a rapid, reflexive strike that favors speed over power or accuracy, while a hip shot is a quick “spray and pray” attack.
A blind strike or hip shot is the fastest type of attack, but it suffers a penalty equal to the weapon’s Bulk (minimum penalty –2, even for Bulk 1 or 0 weapons).
No effect may ever reduce the tick cost of a blind strike or hip shot below 1.
### Snap Strikes and Snap Shots
A snap strike is a close combat attack with at least some degree of proficiency and muscle memory behind it.
A snap shot is a fast, reflexive shot using the weapon’s sights.
These are the middle ground of attacks, neither particularly fast nor excessively accurate.
No bonuses or penalties apply to snap strikes and snap shots; they are the default attack type.
No effect may ever reduce the tick cost of a snap strike or snap shot below 1.

## Calculated Strikes and Aimed Shots 
With a calculated strike, the attacker carefully times his strike to meet an opening in the target’s defenses.
Likewise, a character making an aimed shot pauses for a second in the midst of combat to steady his weapon and concentrate on the mechanics of his attack.
 After all other penalty reduction effects are calculated, the total penalties applied to a calculated strike or aimed shot are halved.
 No effect may ever reduce the tick cost of a calculated strike or aimed shot below 3.
 In addition, an aimed shot does not suffer from recoil effects (see p. 147).
 
## Attack Speeds 
If all attacks occurred at the same speed, no rational player would ever choose for a character to employ anything but a calculated strike or aimed shot.
However, as previously mentioned, speed is the factor against which the relative accuracy of the three attack types is balanced.
Every weapon has a Speed trait which provides three values in ascending order.
These are respectively the tick costs for these three attack types.

Example: Matt’s AK-47 has Speed 3/5/7.
A hip shot with it costs 3 ticks, a snap shot costs 5 ticks, and an aimed shot costs 7 ticks.
 The rifle has Bulk 3, so a hip shot incurs a –3 penalty.
 
# complications 
Several factors can make attacks easier or more difficult.

## Visibility
Both ranged and close combat attacks require the attacker to be able to see the target.
Any penalties to visual tasks apply to attacks.
The basic Reflex System rules (see p. 74) describe the limit of visual range and conditions that can reduce it.
Note that certain equipment, such as night-vision gear, can negate some visual penalties.

## Moving Targets
Any attack is an attempt to bring two objects – the target and the projectile or weapon – into contact.
Coordinating such an action is more difficult when both are in motion.
A moving target inflicts penalties on all attacks, depending on its speed relative to the attacker:

Table 5c: Movement Penalties

Note that although most vehicles move at speeds much higher than those of which characters are capable, their motion is also more predictable.
Few vehicles are capable of altering their vectors as readily as living beings.

## Easy Targets
The Reflex System assumes that combat is a two-sided affair and that all participants are actively trying to avoid incoming attacks, either actively (dodging) or passively (using cover and concealment).
If a target is unaware that he is about to be attacked and is therefore not engaged in any such defensive measures, any attack on him receives a +4 bonus.
For game purposes, any character who has not yet made an initiative check in the current combat scene is considered to be unaware, as is one who is unconscious.
Likewise, all stationary inanimate objects are also “unaware” targets – in more than one sense – and attacks on them receive an equivalent bonus.

A target who is aware he’s being attacked but who lacks freedom of movement is still an easy target, albeit not as easy.
 Attacks on such an individual receive a +2 bonus.
This bonus also applies to attacks on a target who can’t perceive his attacker’s location (for example, due to blindness or camouflage).

# hit location 
If an attack succeeds, the next step is to determine which part of the target’s body it strikes.
This requires a roll of two d6 of different colors (to eliminate confusion) on the hit location table, using one die result for horizontal placement and the other for vertical placement: Die Roll 

Table 5d: Hit Location 

Example: Ed makes a successful attack against an enemy infan- tryman.
He rolls an orange d6 for lateral placement and a green d6 for vertical placement.
Respectively, the die results are a 6 and a 2.
 Ed’s attack strikes his target in the right forearm.
 
# Called Attacks 
Basic marksmanship training teaches novice shooters to aim for the target’s center of mass to maximize hit potential.
The hit location table reflects this, with a torso hit being the greatest probability.
In some situations, however, attackers will want to target specific parts of a victim in order to avoid armor or cover, to effect a disarm, or to maximize the chances of the target’s survival or death.
This requires a called attack.

The attacker must designate an attack as called when he declares the attack action, before making his skill check to determine if he hits or misses.
A called attack is declared against one of the six hit locations: head, torso, or a limb.
If the attack succeeds, the attacker doesn’t roll for hit location as normal – instead, the attack automatically strikes the declared location.
If the attack fails, it completely misses the target as normal.
 
 Under normal circumstances, every attack is governed by a fixed attribute.
A called attack is governed by the lower of the normal attribute or the attacker’s Coolness Under Fire.
 In addition, called attacks to specific locations have additional effects:
 
  •Head: A called attack to the head suffers a –4 penalty.
If it succeeds, however, its total damage is increased by 2.
 
 •Limb: A called attack to an arm or leg suffers a –2 penalty.
 If it succeeds, however, its total damage is increased by 1.

 •Torso: A called attack to the torso suffers a –1 penalty.

# cover 
Smart combatants don’t stand upright in the open while bullets are flying – they seek cover.
For game purposes, cover is defined as any solid object that occupies space between an attacker and a target.
Whenever a successful attack occurs against a target that is behind cover, it has a chance of striking the cover rather than the intended target.

 Rather than attempt to comprehensively define all possible arrangements of cover, the Reflex System takes a common-sense approach.
Any cover provides as much coverage as the players and GM agree upon (in the case of disputes, the GM is, as always, the final authority).
When a character under cover sustains an attack, the attacker rolls for hit location as normal.
If the indicated location is determined to be behind cover, the cover functions as armor (see p. 152) for that hit location.
 
 Example: Leslie kneels behind a stone wall and levels her G36 to fire on an enemy squad.
Because she has to use both hands to op- erate the rifle, she has to expose her arms and head.
Everything below shoulder level is considered to be behind cover from an at- tacker on the far side of the wall.

 Immediately after Leslie takes cover, an enemy successfully at- tacks her.
The GM rolls for hit location and receives an “upper abdomen” result.
Because Leslie is under cover below the shoul- ders, the bullet strikes the stone wall before it gets to her.
The wall has Armor 6, so damage against Leslie’s torso is resolved with the benefit of this armor value.

 If a target is completely behind cover relative to a given character, then that character can’t see the target and therefore can’t declare attacks against it.
However, any such situation cuts both ways – the target can’t see the would-be attacker either.
At the GM’s discretion, an attack against a target under total cover is possible if and only if the attacker knows the target’s position to within a meter (for example, the target has just taken refuge behind the only tree in view).
Even if the GM allows such an attack, it still suffers a –5 penalty.

## Typical Armor Values
The following table provides Armor values for some of the most common items that characters might use for cover.
Fractional values are considered zero unless a weapon’s Penetration raises them to 1 or higher.
 Building Materials Cover 
 
 Table 5e: Cover Armor Values 
 
 The samples above obviously don’t begin to cover all possible scenery and obstacles.
The following values are provided for GMs to calculate the Armor value of a given piece of cover based on its predominant construction.
For the sake of convenience, this table provides both the millimeters of cover necessary to provide an Armor value of 1 and a factor by which to multiply the cover’s thickness to determine Armor.

Material 

## Vehicles as Cover 
Vehicles deserve special consideration when used as cover because they are complex and valuable systems in their own right.
 In many cases, damage to a vehicle will be as important as damage to the characters within or behind it (see p. 279).
However, if the vehicle is unimportant to the story – for example, already a burned-out wreck – the following guidelines apply.

 Unarmored vehicle bodies have no magical capacity for stopping incoming fire, while armored ones perform exactly as usual.
If a character suffers a direct attack while inside a vehicle, apply the vehicle’s Armor normally.
If he suffers a direct attack while outside a vehicle and using it as cover, also apply the vehicle’s traits normally.
However, if the attack passes completely through the vehicle – for example, it enters the driver’s door and exits the passenger’s door – double the Armor value.
If the character is using the vehicle’s engine for cover, rather than simply hiding behind a body panel, add 12 to the base Armor value.

# ranged attacks
Forthe past severalcenturies, mostcombatantshavepreferred killing at range to getting their hands dirty.
The dominant tool for this purpose has been the firearm.
Thus, the Reflex System focuses on firearm-based ranged combat as the default method of attacks.
Other possibilities are addressed with rules exceptions or expansions later in this chapter.

To make a ranged attack, a character must have a ranged weapon ready, and he must be able to see his intended target (unless using indirect fire - see p. 163).
The Coordination attribute, which defines a character’s hand-eye coordination and instinctive grasp of three-dimensional movement, governs all ranged attacks.

## range 
In a gunfight involving rifles that can kill from a kilometer away, a difference in range of a few meters rarely matters.
 Accordingly, the Reflex System avoids the use of precise range measurements in favor of broadly descriptive range bands.
The easiest way to envision range bands is as a set of concentric circles with the character at the center.
Each range band has an inner and outer boundary, and anything whose distance from the character falls within those two boundaries is within that band.
Range bands, from closest to farthest, are:

• Personal: Personal range is within arm’s reach of a character, or close enough to physically strike with a hand weapon.
 Characters must be within personal range of one another to engage in physical contact, whether consensual (e.g. first aid) or hostile (e.g. a knife fight).

 •Gunfighting: Gunfighting range is from just outside arm’s reach to 7 meters.
According to law enforcement statistics, this is the range within which the vast majority of modern handgun combat occurs.
 
 •Close Quarters Battle (CQB): CQB range begins at 7 meters and extends to 25 meters, which makes it the maximum range at which most combat within buildings or large vehicles will occur.

 •Tight: Tight range is from 25 to 100 meters, the range at which most gunfights occur within cities, jungles, and other outdoor areas that tightly restrict movement and lines of sight.
In the Tight range band and under normal field conditions the human eye will pick a human-sized target out of its surroundings more than 90% of the time.

 • Medium: The range that most military-scale combats will occur in surroundings with a moderate degree of cover and terrain complications.
 The Medium range band extends from 100 to 200 meters.
This is the practical limit at which the unaided eye can discern significant details of a subject.
Under normal field conditions, an average observer will discern a standing human target about 50% of the time at Medium range.
 
 •Open:Asthenameimplies,theOpenrangebandencompasses the ranges at which most infantry actions take place in open terrain with minimal contours: 200 to 400 meters.
Visual observation normally encounters minimal penalties at these distances.
Under normal field conditions, an average observer will discern a standing human target about 15% of the time at Open range.

 • Sniping: The range band from 400 to 800 meters is the province of long-range weapons.
Visual observation can be significantly impaired at these distances.
Under normal field conditions, the unaided human eye has less than a 5% chance of detecting standing human targets at Sniping range.
Ranged attacks without magnifying optics are effectively impossible.

•Extreme: From 800 to 1,600 meters, only the longest- ranged firearms have a chance of hitting man-sized objects.
 Unaided visual observation is limited to simple shapes and major details, and the naked eye cannot effectively discern a human target.
 
## Range Bands and Weapons 
Every ranged weapon has both an optimum range and a maximum range. A weapon’s optimum range is the distance at which it provides the best possible balance of speed and accuracy.
 If a target is within a range band that’s closer than the weapon’s optimum range, attacks take more time, as the wielder has to fight the weapon’s inertia to swing it to bear on a new target.
Every range band closer then optimum adds a cumulative +1 to the tick cost of all attacks.

If a target is within a range band beyond the weapon’s optimum range, attacks suffer an accuracy penalty: a cumulative – 3 per range band.
A weapon has no reasonable chance of accuracy against targets in range bands farther away than its maximum range, even though it may theoretically be capable of launching a projectile that far.

Example: An M4A1 carbine’s optimum range is Tight and its maximum range is Open.
Attacks against targets in CQB, Gun- fighting, or Personal range take more ticks than normal to re- solve – respectively, +1, +2, and +3 ticks as the target grows pro- gressively closer.
Attacks against targets in Tight range suffer no speed or accuracy penalties.
Attacks against targets in Medium or Open range suffer respective –3 and –6 accuracy penalties (in addition to any penalties applied by the limit of visual range - see p. 74).
No attacks are possible against targets in Sniping or Ex- treme range.
 This doesn’t mean that a bullet fired from an M4A1 is physically incapable of traveling 800 meters, but rather that the weapon is so inaccurate at that range that no shooter has a chance of hitting a man-sized target without laboratory condi- tions for the shot.
 
## Odd-Sized Targets
The default target size in the Reflex System is an adult human body, as the vast majority of attacks target adult humans.
In some situations, characters will want to shoot at things significantly larger or smaller than this size.
For attacks that target specific parts of a human body, use the Called Attacks rules (see p. 144).
 For ranged attacks on targets larger or smaller than normal, apply the same range modifiers that affect visual observation: Human Size Equivalence Table 5g: Size Range Modifiers
 
# options
  The basic ranged attack rules assume that a character is attacking a single specific target with a single projectile.
In many engagements, particularly with military-grade weapons, this isn’t a safe assumption.
The following rules address the most common special cases that can arise with firearms.

## [[Burst Fire]]
Some firearms – typically submachine guns, assault rifles, and machine guns – are capable of firing more than one round with each trigger pull.
The Reflex System treats all such capabilities as burst fire.
A weapon that a character can fire in this manner is designated with a “B#” notation in its Rate of Fire trait.
The “#” is the number of rounds the weapon fires with each burst (e.g.
 “B3” indicates that the weapon fires three-round bursts).
A burst can be applied to any hip, snap, or aimed shot.

 When a character fires a burst rather than a single round, the additional volume of lead he’s sending downrange increases his chances of hitting the target.
A burst attack receives a bonus equal to the number of additional rounds being fired (e.g.
 a three-round burst provides a +2 bonus).

When a burst fire attack hits, it’s possible that more than one round strikes the target.
Roll a number of d6s equal to the number of additional rounds being fired.
Every die result of 1 indicates another hit on the same hit location that the first round struck.
 Every die result of 2 or 3 indicates another hit on a randomly- determined hit location.
Every die result of 4 through 6 is a clean miss.
Each additional round that hits uses the attack’s overall margin of success for damage resolution.

Example: Matt makes a burst attack with his AK-47, which has a Rate of Fire of B4.
He’s firing a four-round burst, so he receives a +3 bonus.
Matt’s attack succeeds, so he rolls for hit location for the first round, then rolls 3d6.
 The dice come up 1, 3, and 4.
 Matt hits the target with two additional rounds: one in the same loca- tion as the first, and another in a randomly-determined location.
 The fourth bullet misses entirely.
Matt marks off four rounds from his magazine.

A burst always expends a number of rounds equal to those being fired – bullets don’t magically multiply.
For example, a four- round burst always consumes four rounds.
 If a weapon doesn’t have enough ammunition remaining for a full burst, the burst empties the weapon and is resolved with the actual number of rounds fired.
Thus, if a character uses a weapon with a B5 rate of fire to fire a burst, but the weapon only has three rounds remaining, the resulting attack is treated as if the weapon had only a B3 rate of fire.

# [[recoil]]
All firearms are subject to recoil, the momentum that the explosion of a cartridge’s propellant imparts to the gun.
For the shooter, the primary effect of recoil is to jerk the gun off-target, which makes rapid subsequent shots more difficult.
Any weapon with a Recoil value is subject to the following rules.

## Single Shots
Every time a character makes an attack with a firearm, compare the gun’s Recoil to the shooter’s Muscle.
If Recoil exceeds Muscle, the character’s next action suffers a penalty equal to the difference.
This applies only if the next action is a hip shot or snap shot with the same weapon.

 Example: Matt has Muscle 9.
As his first action of this exchange of fire, he fires an aimed shot with a .
300 Winchester Magnum hunting rifle (Recoil 13).
  This attack suffers no penalty.
Matt then makes a second attack, this one a snap shot.
The second at- tack is subject to a recoil penalty of –4 (the difference between Matt’s Muscle and the weapon’s Recoil).
Matt reloads, then makes a third attack, again a snap shot.
Because of the interven- ing action between the second and third attack, the third attack suffers no recoil penalty.

## [[Burst Fire]]
Any attack using burst fire is subject to recoil.
Even the slowest-firing automatic weapon has a cyclic rate high enough to unleash the second bullet before the shooter can compensate for the recoil of the first.
When a character fires a burst attack, add the number of rounds in the burst to the weapon’s Recoil value.
If this modified Recoil exceeds the shooter’s Muscle, the attack suffers a penalty equal to the difference.
This is in addition to any effect the weapon’s modified Recoil has on any following attack.

Example: Matt returns to using his trusty AK-47.
His Strength of 9 exceeds the weapon’s Recoil of 7, so he suffers no recoil penalty for single shots.
However, if he fires a four-round burst, the AK- 47’s modified Recoil value will be 11, so he will suffer a –2 penalty (the difference between his Muscle and the weapon’s burst Recoil).

## Other Factors
A weapon’s base Recoil value assumes that the shooter is using the number of hands for which the gun was designed: one for a handgun, two for a longarm.
A shooter gripping a handgun with both hands increases his effective Muscle by 2.
Conversely, a shooter using only one hand for a longarm halves his Muscle (unless the gun is permanently attached to a tripod or other fixed mount).
A character’s stance also can increase his effective Muscle.

### Design Note: Rock and Roll 
Yes, it’s possible to hold down the trigger on a fully automatic weapon and spray lead in a continuous stream until the ammo runs out or the barrel melts.
However, no one who actually knows how to use such a gun does this, especially in a post-apocalyptic world without ammunition factories.
Recoil from sustained automatic fire quickly leads to muzzle climb, which means all of the following rounds are being wasted skyward.
The proper method of using automatic fire is short, controlled bursts, with a quick recovery between each burst to keep the weapon on target.
We’ve chosen to replicate this reality by not providing explicit rules for bullet hosing.
The superior capabilities of weapons designed for sustained automatic fire – machine guns – are already replicated in the bonuses they receive to burst fire.
 
 With this said, it’s possible that untrained characters will get their hands on military firearms over the course of play.
At the GM’s discretion, a character who doesn’t understand the principle of short, controlled bursts uses double the ammunition and suffers a –2 penalty to each burst attack.
Such attacks can never hit with more bullets than the default number fired in a (trained) burst; the extra rounds are always wasted.

#### Design Note: Recoil
The intent behind the recoil rules is to emphasize the fact that a character takes a measurable fraction of a second to recover from firing a powerful weapon.
If he makes a hip or snap shot immediately after making a previous attack that he’s not strong enough to control, he’s still bringing the gun back on target when he pulls the trigger again.
Aimed shots don’t suffer this penalty because the increased Speed of an aimed shot includes the character steadying the gun before firing.

 If a weapon has a bipod, shooting with the bipod down (which requires the character to be stationary - and prone or otherwise braced) reduces the weapon’s base Recoil by 2.
If the weapon is permanently affixed to a tripod, a vehicle weapon mount, or a similar fixed mount, its base Recoil is halved.

# other ranged weapons 
Firearms aren’t the only means by which characters can kill each other beyond arm’s length.

## Archery
Bows, crossbows, and spearguns are all ranged weapons whose projectiles are slower and heavier than bullets.
All have roughly similar ballistic performance, so attacks with them fall under the Archery skill.
These weapons are susceptible to high winds in the same manner as thrown weapons (see p. 75).
In all other respects, ranged attacks with them are resolved as per the basic firearm rules.
## Throwing
Throwing is a basic task that most humans learn (admittedly, with varying degrees of mastery) by age six.
Accordingly, no specialized skill exists for attacks with thrown weapons; instead, a Coordination attribute check governs this task.
The character’s Muscle attribute determines the attack’s optimum and maximum ranges: 

Table 5h: Throwing Range Bands

These ranges assume a thrown item with weight roughly equal to that of a normal hand grenade, knife, Molotov cocktail, javelin, or rock: between 0.
1 and 1 kg.
For heavier items (up to half the character’s Muscle value in kilograms), reduce both optimum and maximum ranges by one range band.
For items whose weight exceeds this limit, thrown attacks are impossible.

## Hand Grenades
A hand grenade is unlike other explosive weapons in that it isn’t fused to detonate on impact.
Instead, it has a time delay fuse, typically designed for three to five seconds.
Once activated, the fuse cannot be stopped.
What this means in game terms is that a grenade will detonate 1d10+4 ticks after it is thrown.
In addition, hand grenades are considered indirect-fire weapons, so failed attacks with them are subject to the Stage III deviation rules (see p. 164).

 A character who wants to lessen the chance of an enemy picking up a live grenade and throwing it back may attempt to “cook” the grenade.
This requires an Activate/Deactivate Equipment action to pull the pin and start the fuse.
The character may then hold the grenade as long as he wants prior to making his attack with it.
However, the time remaining on a grenade’s fuse isn’t externally evident, so the GM should secretly make the roll for detonation time.

## Heavy Weapons
When all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.
Inevitably, players will want their characters to use heavy weapons against other characters, either for the sake of expediency or to absolutely ensure the demise of a particularly important target.
  This is not necessarily an easy task, though.
Most anti- vehicular weapons are designed for precision relative to the size of their intended targets.
Firing at a human, whose visual profile is an order of magnitude or two smaller than that of a tank, requires unerring accuracy on the part of the gunner.
The following rules apply to all weapons fired with the Gunnery and Support Weapons skills (weapons fired with Artillery are completely incapable of sufficient precision to target an individual character).

 •Machine guns of all types are intended for area targets or suppressive fire rather than accuracy against point targets.
 However, they are conventional small-caliber firearms and thus are sufficiently accurate to suffer no penalties when fired against individual characters.
 
 •Flamethrowers are not officially intended for use against personnel.
However, their hose-like nature makes adjusting aim easy enough that they suffer no penalties for use against personnel.

•Squad support weapons, such as grenade launchers and man-portable rocket launchers, are intended for use against small vehicles or massed infantry.
Accordingly, these weapons are less difficult to use against characters than larger ones are.
An attack on a character with such a weapon incurs a –3 penalty.
The same guidelines apply to light autocannon.
 
 • Anti-tank weapons, including ATGMs and cannon, are designed to engage significantly larger targets.
Attacks on personnel with these vehicles suffer a –6 penalty. [why not just make attacks one range band worse?]
Attacks on smaller passenger vehicles such as cars and SUVs suffer a –3 penalty.

 •Although outside the scope of these rules, weapons built to the even larger scale of structures or ships are completely incapable of targeting characters.
This includes all aircraft-dropped bombs, torpedoes, cruise missiles, naval guns, and similar anti-ship or bombardment weapons.

# close combat attacks

Close combat involves attacks and counter-maneuvers that occur within the Personal range band.
The majority of such attacks will involve either bare hands or hand weapons, though firearms may see occasional use as per the Gun Fu rules (see p. 151).

Close combat receives a slightly greater degree of abstraction than ranged combat does.
In reality, most close combat fights involve more than a simple series of attacks and occasional blocks.
 Opponents maneuver for position, close and separate, and feint in a constant dance.
Most attacks aren’t single strikes, but rather rapid combinations of maneuvers intended to get the final strike or strikes through the enemy’s defenses.
However, precisely replicating these subtle complexities would significantly slow down the pace of combat.
For this reason, we’ve reduced close combat in the Stage I and II rules sets to the same three basic attack types as ranged combat, with a couple of additional refinements thrown in.
 For narrative purposes, players and GMs are safe in describing a single Attack action in terms of several discrete maneuvers: “I wait for him to overextend, weave around, and give him an elbow to the back of the neck.”
 
## Odd-Sized Targets 
The default target size in the Reflex System is an adult human body, as the vast majority of attacks target adult humans.
In some situations, characters will want to kick or stab things significantly larger or smaller than this size.
For attacks that target specific parts of a human body, use the Called Attacks rules (see p. 144).
 For attacks on targets larger or smaller than normal, apply the following modifiers: 
 
 Human Size Equivalence Table 5i: Size Modifiers

## options
  Close combat enables a character to make full use of the range of motion of the human body – both his own and his opponent’s.
 This allows for some tactics which the simple kinetic energy exchanges of ranged combat do not permit.

## Blocks
Unlike ranged attacks, which involve projectiles moving faster than normal human reflex speed can anticipate, close combat attacks can be deflected by the target.
The Block action allows a character to attempt this feat.

 To block an incoming close combat attack, a character must take the Block action within one tick of the beginning of the attack (so if an attack is declared on Tick 14, the target must block on Tick 14 or Tick 13).
Remember that a Block action has a tick cost equal to 1 plus the weapon’s Blind Strike Speed.
The player then makes either a Hand-to-Hand (OODA) or Hand Weapons (OODA) skill check, depending on whether he’s blocking with bare hands or a held object.
This check opposes the attacker’s attack check, as per standard results for opposed actions.
 
 Example: Max attempts to block an incoming knife attack with his police baton.
The baton has Speed 2/3/5, so the Block ac- tion costs 3 ticks (1 plus the baton’s Blind Strike Speed of 2).
The attacker’s margin of success on his Hand Weapons skill check was 4.
Max makes a Hand Weapons (OODA) check to oppose this, receiving a margin of success of 5.
This gives the attacker a net margin of failure of 1.
The knife carves a few slivers of poly- mer from the baton, but it saves Max from taking a nasty stab wound.
 
 If a character employs bare-handed defense against an edged weapon, he runs the risk of sustaining injury to his arm even if the block technically succeeds.
In such a case, there is a flat 50% chance that with a successful block, the defender still sustains damage to a randomly-selected arm equal to the weapon’s base Damage.

Conversely, if a character uses a close combat weapon to deflect an unarmed attack, he may be able to injure his attacker with a successful block.
In such a case, there is a flat 50% chance that with a successful block, the attacker sustains damage to the attacking limb equal to the blocking weapon’s base Damage.

## Diving Strikes
A character can use his own body as a projectile.
As with any other moving object, the amount of kinetic energy delivered in such a collision increases with speed.
In a diving strike, a character moves toward a target at a trot or faster speed, ends his movement within close combat range, and immediately makes a close combat attack.
This attack may be combined with the movement, as per the standard rules for tactical movement, or it may be the action the character takes immediately after moving.

 A diving strike suffers a penalty determined by the movement speed of the attacker: –3 for a sprint, –2 for a run, or –1 for a trot.
 If the attack succeeds, its base Damage is increased by double the penalty: +6 for a sprint, +4 for a run, or +2 for a trot.
In addition, the target must successfully oppose the attack with a Muscle check or be knocked prone (success on this opposed action does not count as a Block action).
 
## the empty hand 
In close combat, a character’s bare hands are treated as a standard close combat weapon for purposes of speed and damage.
Any character’s bare hands (feet, knees, elbows, foreheads, et cetera) have Damage 0, Penetration Nil, Bulk 0, and Speed 1/2/4.

 (Some readers may feel that this intentionally short-changes trained martial artists who have developed “deadly hands” via decades of esoteric training.
However, such characters should be built with high Muscle values and Hand-to-Hand skill ratings.
 These two factors will lead to greater average margins of success on attacks, which translate directly into more damage.
We feel that this is sufficient.
The Reflex System has no rules for Secret Squirrel Dim Mak Death Touch.)

After resolving any diving strike, the attacker must succeed in a Muscle check or fall prone.
This check suffers the same penalty for the attacker’s speed that the original attack suffered.
If the attack failed, this penalty is doubled.

 Example: Seeing another enemy taking aim on Pete with a snip- er rifle, Max charges with his baton leveled.
He takes a Move- ment action at running speed, immediately following it up with an Attack action, making a blind strike with his baton.
The attack suffers a –2 penalty for the run in addition to the standard penal- ties for a blind strike.
Max succeeds with a margin of success of 4.
The attack’s Damage is increased by 4 for the diving strike in addition to all other modifiers.

Max’s opponent must make a Muscle check or go prone.
Because Max had a margin of success of 4, his target needs a margin of success of at least 5 to stay on his feet.
Max also must make a Muscle check to stay up, suffering a –2 penalty for running.

## Grappling
Any close combat attack or block may be an attack to grapple or block to grapple.
Mechanically, this occurs as normal, but changes the skill check to require the /Grapple qualification (as usual, an unqualified attempt is possible but suffers a penalty of 3 skill levels).
When making a grapple attempt, a character does not attempt to injure his opponent, but to reduce or eliminate his mobility.
A successful grapple does not inflict damage; instead, it inflicts a Control value equal to the margin of success (so a zero margin of success grants no Control).
Control is an abstract measure of the degree of physical control that one character has over another.
It depicts the extent of joint locks, pins, compliance holds, and other restrictions on movement.

If a character succeeds in a diving grapple, the normal damage bonus from a diving strike translates to extra Control: 3 for a sprint, 2 for a run, or 1 for a trot.

## Grappling With Weapons 
Although most close combat weapons don’t have the flexibility or grasping ability of the human hand, it’s still possible to execute a grapple attack with one.
In such an event, the attacker uses his weapon for leverage to enact joint locks, or wedges an appropriate part of it into a pressure point.
A knife point under the eye is just as effective in gaining compliance as a thumb in a nerve cluster.

### Maintaining Control 
Grappling comes with a price for an attacker.
Once an attacker has Control on a target, he must maintain his advantage or lose all Control.
 While maintaining Control, an attacker may only make the Attack, Block, Communicate, Ready Item, and Wait tactical actions.
 Any actions against a target other than the controlled victim suffer a –3 penalty.
If the attacker takes any other tactical action or any operational action, or if he declares a hold at the end of an exchange of fire, he loses all of the Control he currently has on his target.
### Effects of Control 
A Controlled character suffers a penalty to all physical actions equal to half the total Control that all attackers currently have on him.
This penalty is halved again for actions taken against a character who is exerting Control on the victim.
 A character under Control also suffers from reduced movement capability.
Any attempt to move requires a Muscle check, opposed by the Muscle check of the Controlling character.
 If the victim succeeds, he may move a maximum number of meters equal to his margin of success.
This movement may not exceed the normal limits imposed by injury, encumbrance, and the character’s normal movement rates.
 Using Control A character who has Control over an opponent has several options available to him, depending on his current Control value.
 Each of the following actions has a minimum Control which the attacker must have.

 •Increase Control (minimum 1): The attacker attempts to consolidate his hold on his victim, making another attack to grapple.
If the attack succeeds, it inflicts no damage, but its margin of success is added to the character’s current Control.
 
 •Compliance Hold (minimum 2): Pain and the threat of (further) physical injury can go a long way toward discouraging continued aggression.
The attacker makes a close combat attack against the victim, receiving a bonus equal to half his current Control.
 If it succeeds, it inflicts no damage.
However, for the purposes of morale (see p. 159), the victim becomes subject to a number of threat conditions equal to half the attacker’s margin of success.
 
 • Disarm (minimum 4): Normally, a disarm is accomplished with a called shot to the limb holding the weapon.
 An attacker who doesn’t want to inflict injury instead makes a close combat attack against the victim, opposed by a Muscle attribute check on the victim’s part.
If the attacker succeeds, the victim drops whatever is in one hand of the attacker’s choice.
With a margin of success of 5 or more, the victim releases the contents of both hands.

 •Attack (minimum 4): The attacker uses his dominance and leverage to make a joint bend the way it isn’t supposed to, or to get a blade into the victim’s eye socket.
He makes a normal close combat attack, but adds his Control as a bonus to the skill check.
If this bonus exceeds +5, it is subject to the normal cap of +5, but any remaining bonus is applied to reducing the penalty of any called strike the attacker chooses to make.

 • Choke Out (minimum of victim’s Muscle +3): Despite the name, this maneuver doesn’t cut off the victim’s air supply, but rather the blood flow to his brain.
It requires an entire exchange of fire to accomplish – the attacker must declare it as his first action, and it has a Speed equal to the attacker’s starting initiative.
At the end of the exchange of fire, if the attacker still has the minimum control necessary to start this maneuver, the victim makes a Fitness check.
If this Fitness check succeeds, the victim falls unconscious.
If the check fails, the victim dies, and resuscitation attempts treat him as if he had a critical head injury.
 If the attacker still has Control at the end of the exchange of fire but can’t meet this maneuver’s minimum, the current injury condition of the victim’s head worsens by one level.
 
 Escape A character who is suffering from Control may attempt to break free.
This requires a standard close combat attack, but the attack must be declared as an attack to escape.
A successful attack to escape does not inflict damage; instead, it reduces Control by its margin of success.

## Gun Fu 
Ranged weapons aren’t designed for use at contact ranges, but some circumstances leave a shooter no choice.
A character wielding a firearm may use it to make attacks at Personal range.
 This requires a check with the appropriate skill, using Muscle rather than the standard Coordination.
Any such attack suffers the normal penalty for attacking at a range closer than optimum.
 In addition, the target may attempt a Block action as if the attack were a standard close combat attack.
Diving strikes provide no bonus to such attacks, though a firearm may be used as a blunt implement in a grapple attempt.

## other Ranged Weapons
Most ranged weapons other than firearms aren’t usable at Personal range.
Bows require too much freedom of movement to be wielded (through crossbows can be used in the same manner as firearms).
Heavy weapons are too bulky to be fired at Personal range; any such attack automatically fails.

 Throwing is likewise useless, though most thrown weapons can be used as direct impact tools.
Throwing knives, javelins, and the like function as standard close combat weapons.
Grenades are equivalent to rocks.
If a character wants to drop a live grenade at his feet, this requires no attack – he just has to ready it, activate it, and ditch it.

# damage 
Every character has a set of wound thresholds for each hit location (or, under Stage I rules, one set of wound thresholds for his entire body) that define his ability to sustain injury.
Whenever a character receives damage, compare the amount of damage received to his wound thresholds for the affected location.
The highest threshold that the damage equals or exceeds is the degree of injury that the character suffers (see p. 152 for effects).

Example: Pete’s torso has a slight wound threshold of 1, a mod- erate wound threshold of 8, a serious wound threshold of 16, and a critical wound threshold of 24.
Pete receives a hit to his torso with a damage value of 11.
This amount of damage exceeds his slight and moderate wound thresholds, but not his serious or crit- ical wound threshold, so Pete suffers a moderate torso wound.

## attacks
Characters can receive damage in many ways, but the most common form will be deliberate attacks.
When an attack against a character is successful, add the attacker’s margin of success to the attack’s Damage value to determine the total damage value of the hit.

Example: In the above example, a guerrilla shot at Pete.
The guerrilla used a rifle with Damage 7 and received a margin of success of 4.
The total damage value of the hit was 11.

## The Rule of Zero
Any normal attack whose margin of success is exactly zero is a glancing or grazing hit.
Such an attack cannot inflict worse than a slight wound, regardless of its Damage value.
When dealing with a direct attack using an explosive projectile, the Rule of Zero indicates that the warhead didn’t strike the target with enough force to trigger its fuse and detonate its explosive payload.

## passive hazards
Most of the ways a character can sustain injury involve some form of hostile intent – in other words, they’re attacks.
Some things, however, are dangerous even though they don’t involve the intent and skill of an attacker.
These sources of damage are  considered passive hazards, so called because they don’t involve a direct active attempt on the victim’s life.
 Every passive hazard has three traits: a Damage value, a Penetration value, and an Avoidance Check (see p. 156 for common passive hazards).
The Damage and Penetration values are identical in function to those of a weapon.
The Avoidance Check is an attribute check that the player must make whenever the character is exposed to the hazard in question.
If the check succeeds, the character manages to twist out of the way, hold his breath, or otherwise evade the hazard, and he suffers no damage.
 If the check fails, the margin of failure is added to the hazard’s Damage to determine the total amount of damage that the victim suffers.

 Example: Ed and Simon are attempting to escape a burning building and must run through part of the fire.
The fire has Damage 4 and Avoidance Check MUS (TN –2).
Ed succeeds on his Muscle check and suffers no damage.
Simon fails his Muscle check with a margin of failure of 5; he suffers a damage value of 9.

## recurring injuries
  If a character is already injured and suffers an additional wound of equal severity to the same location, the severity of the existing injury is increased by one level.
For example, a character with a moderate injury to the left arm who suffers another moderate hit to the left arm would instead receive a serious injury to the left arm.
Further moderate injuries to the left arm would not raise the arm’s injury level any further, but a subsequent serious injury to the left arm would worsen the arm’s condition to critical.
 
##  less-lethal damage 
 No source of injury can ever be truly “non-lethal.
”A human can drown in half an inch of water or bleed out from a surgical incision, given sufficient ill fortune.
Every day, people die from injuries sustained from nothing more than aggressive bare-handed attacks.
Consequently, the Reflex System does not have a separate mechanic for what modern weapon manufacturers euphemistically term “less-lethal” attacks.
Weapons designed to stun rather than kill are likely to have low Damage values, but may have other effects in addition to the raw physical trauma they inflict.
## protection
Body armor, vehicle armor, and cover provide some measure of protection against incoming attacks and accidents.
Each such piece of equipment or scenery has an Armor value which roughly defines its resistance to kinetic energy.
 
 An attack’s Penetration is a measure of how well it transfers energy through armor or other protection to the character or equipment protected by that armor.
Penetration is a multiplier – in other words, when an attack strikes a target, multiply the target’s printed Armor value by the attack’s Penetration value to determine the armor’s actual effectiveness against the attack 

After determining the protection’s actual Armor value against the attack, subtract that number from the attack’s total damage value.
 If the result is zero or less, the attack inflicts no injury or damage.

 Example 1: Pete is hit again in identical fashion, suffering a dam- age value of 11.
This time, however, he’s wearing a vest with Armor 2.
 The attack has a Penetration rating of x2.
 Armor 2 multiplied by Penetration x2 equals an effective Armor value of 4.
Subtracting 4 from the damage value of 11 yields a final damage value of 7.
 
 Example 2: Pete is hit a third time, once more with a damage value of 11 and Penetration x2, but now he’s behind a cinder block wall (Armor 9).
Armor 9 multiplied by Penetration x2 is 18.
The wall’s effective Armor value exceeds the attack’s damage value, so Pete suffers no injury.
 
 Some damage sources are particularly poor at penetrating anything denser than human flesh.
These damage sources have a “Nil” Penetration value.
 Such an attack inflicts no injury or damage through any protection that has a nonzero Armor value.

# injury
Injuries are an unavoidable part of combat.
 As described in the preceding rules, whenever a character suffers damage, the degree of injury he sustains is dependent on the total damage he suffers and the wound thresholds of the affected body location.
Each body location has wound thresholds for four degrees of injury.
Each of these degrees of injury has common effects that apply regardless of the location, as well as location-specific effects.
## wound penalties
In the Reflex System, most penalties to task checks are simple numerical modifiers.
Wound penalties are the only mechanism that removes dice from task checks.
This represents the relative severity of injuries compared to external factors.
A thunderstorm is an inconvenience; a sucking chest wound is a real problem.
## Skill Checks 
A wound penalty reduces a character’s effective skill rating for all affected checks by one or more levels, which, in turn, reduces the number of dice the player rolls and the total number of bonuses he may add.
If a wound penalty reduces a character’s effective skill rating below Unskilled, the character rolls one additional die for each additional level of reduction, taking the highest (and worst) of all dice.
 Example: Pete has an Expert rating in Deception (4d20L), a Competent rating in Medicine (2d20), and a Novice rating in Support Weapons (1d20).
If Pete sustains a moderate head inju- ry, he suffers a –2 skill level penalty to all actions.
His Deception rating drops to Competent (2d20L).
His Medicine rating drops to Unskilled (2d20H).
His Support Weapons rating drops one level below Unskilled (3d20H).
 If multiple wound penalties apply to a single roll, apply only the worst relevant wound penalty.
##  Attribute Checks
  Attribute checks made to actively perform tasks (e.g.
 breaking down a door with Muscle, solving a physics equation with Education) are affected by wound penalties in the same manner as skill checks.
 However, passive attribute checks made solely to resist negative effects (e.g.
 Fitness checks to resist infection, Personality checks to recognize lies) are not affected by wound penalties.
 CUF and OODA attribute checks never suffer from wound penalties.
##  Virtual Injuries
  Some effects inflict virtual injuries, treating a character as if he were suffering from an injury that he has not actually sustained.
 It is possible for a character to sustain both actual and virtual injury to the same location.
In such an event, apply the effects of the worst injury.

Example: Pete is on a party drug which inflicts a moderate vir- tual head injury.
He’s also been clubbed in the head, inflicting a slight head injury.
Pete suffers the effects of a moderate head in- jury.
If he’s clubbed in the head again and sustains a serious head injury, he’ll then suffer the effects of a serious head injury.

## Slight Injuries
”It’s just a flesh wound.
” The character suffers pain and may have unsightly wounds, but is unlikely to be in danger of dying unless he becomes infected.
In peacetime, a slight injury would be treatable with home medicine.
 Common Effects: None.
 Head: A slight head injury inflicts a –1 skill level penalty to all actions.
 Torso: A slight torso injury inflicts a –1 skill level penalty to all physical actions.
 Arm: A slight arm injury inflicts a –1 skill level penalty to all actions involving the use of that arm.
 Leg:A slight leg injury inflicts a –1 skill level penalty to all task checks involving the use of that leg.
In addition, the character cannot sprint.
## Moderate Injuries 
The character sustains a noticeable injury that will cause some degree of lasting impairment until healed.
In peacetime, a moderate injury would call for a non-emergency doctor’s visit (though many people would panic and rush to the ER anyway).
 Common Effects: Whenever a character suffers a moderate injury, the player must succeed in a Fitness check or the character enters shock.
If the margin of failure is greater than 5, the character also becomes unstable.
 Head: A moderate head injury inflicts a –2 skill level penalty to all actions.
 Torso: A moderate torso injury inflicts a –2 skill level penalty to all physical actions.
 Arm: When a character suffers a moderate arm injury, the player must succeed in an immediate Muscle check or the character drops any object held in that hand.
In addition, a slight arm injury inflicts a –2 skill level penalty to all actions involving the use of that arm.
 Leg: When a character suffers a moderate leg injury, the player must succeed in an immediate Muscle check or the character falls down.
 In addition, a slight leg injury inflicts a –2 skill level penalty to all actions involving the use of that leg, and the character cannot move faster than a walk.
##  Serious Injuries
  The character suffers a significant amount of physical trauma that has the potential to be life-threatening, or to cause permanent impairment if left untreated.
In peacetime, a serious injury would justify an ambulance run and emergency surgical treatment.
 Common Effects: Whenever a character suffers a serious injury, the player must succeed in a Fitness check or the character enters shock.
If the margin of failure is greater than 5, the character also becomes unstable.
 Head: A serious head injury inflicts a –3 skill level penalty to all actions.
 Torso: A serious torso injury inflicts a –3 skill level penalty to all physical actions.
 Arm: When a character suffers a serious arm injury, the player must succeed in an immediate Muscle check (TN –2) or the character drops any object held in that hand.
 In addition, a serious arm injury inflicts a –3 skill level penalty to all actions involving the use of that arm.
 Leg: When a character suffers a serious leg injury, the player must succeed in an immediate Muscle check (TN –2) or the character falls down.
In addition, a slight leg injury inflicts a –3 skill level penalty to all actions involving the use of that leg, and the character cannot move faster than a stagger.
## Critical Injuries
The character suffers immediately life-threatening trauma that will almost certainly cause some degree of permanent impairment unless expertly treated with long-term rehabilitation.
 In peacetime, a critical injury would call for air evacuation to a trauma center.
 Common Effects:A critically injured character automatically enters shock.
 In addition, the player must succeed in a Fitness check or the character becomes unstable.
 Head: A character who sustains a critical head injury instantly becomes unconscious and remains so until the injury is healed to serious.
 Torso: A critical torso injury inflicts a –4 skill level penalty to all physical actions.
 Arm: When a character suffers a critical arm injury, he automatically drops anything held in that hand.
The arm is unusable and any task requiring its use automatically fails.
If the damage inflicted exceeds twice the arm’s critical wound threshold, there is a 50% chance that the arm is catastrophically amputated.
 Leg: When a character suffers a critical leg injury, he automatically falls down.
The leg is unusable and any task requiring its use automatically fails.
The character’s only available mode of movement is crawling.
If the damage inflicted exceeds twice the leg’s critical wound threshold, there is a 50% chance that the leg is catastrophically amputated.
## Shock 
When a character enters shock, his body is beginning to shut down in an attempt to deal with what it perceives as catastrophic trauma.
A character who enters shock is unable to act for the rest of the current exchange of fire.
For the remainder of the scene, any effect that would put the character into shock instead renders him unstable.

 At the beginning of each subsequent exchange of fire, before initiative is rolled, the player must succeed in a CUF check.
If this check succeeds, the character may act normally during the next exchange of fire.
If the check fails, the character is semiconscious and may take no tactical actions.
## Instability
An unstable character is experiencing significant bleeding or other persistent and immediate degradation of his physical condition.
At the end of each subsequent full exchange of fire or pause (or one full minute, in a non-combat situation), every hit location that is injured becomes one level worse.
Uninjured hit locations don’t degrade.
This cycle continues until a hit location that is already critically injured becomes one level worse, at which point the character bleeds out and is clinically dead.

 If a character becomes unstable as a result of a head injury, he also instantly becomes unconscious and remains so for the rest of the scene.

Example: Pete becomes unstable.
He has slight injuries to his left arm and left leg, a moderate injury to his head, and a serious injury to his torso.
At the end of the next pause or exchange of fire, Pete’s left arm and left leg will degrade to moderately injured, his head will degrade to seriously injured, and his torso will degrade to critically injured.
At the end of the following pause or exchange of fire, Pete will bleed out from his critical torso injury.

In anticipation of the need to save characters’ lives, players are advised to become familiar with the first aid rules (see p. 174).

# damaging equipment 
While other characters are the most common targets for attacks, equipment falls victim to misadventure or deliberate harm on a regular basis.
Every solid object has an Armor value and a single damage threshold.
When an item suffers damage, compare the final damage value to its damage threshold.
If the value is less than the threshold, the item loses some cosmetic appeal but continues to function normally.
If the value equals or exceeds the threshold, the item gains 1 point of Wear and becomes disabled.
It no longer works, but repairs are possible (see p. 184).
If an item is already disabled and suffers another hit with damage equal to or in excess of its damage threshold, it is destroyed.

An item’s armor value and damage threshold depend on its construction and size, as per the following table.
If an item is constructed of multiple materials, use the most logical one.
For example, an AK-47 has a wooden stock, but its working parts are made of steel, so it’s considered a steel object for damage purposes.
 At Bulk 3, it has Armor 4 and a damage threshold of 7.
As always, apply common sense over rigid adherence to the rules, particularly if the rules give a nonsensical set of values.

Note that the following rules apply only to personal equipment or objects of equivalent size.
For attempts to damage scenery or structures, see the demolition rules (see p. 195).
 Substance 

# other damage sources
The basic combat rules assume that characters and equipment will most often suffer damage from a direct, intentional application of kinetic energy.
While this is the most common way for a character’s day to be ruined, the world of Twilight: 2013 is full of many other sources of trauma.
## explosions 
Unlike bullets, blades, and fists, all of which inflict damage only at the point of impact, explosions distribute kinetic and thermal energy over a significant volume.
Any character or item near an explosion is at risk.
Accordingly, explosions in the Reflex System have some additional characteristics which other sources of damage do not possess.

From a physics perspective, an explosion is a rapid expansion of gas, usually accompanied by intense heat.
This atmospheric shock wave radiates in all directions from the source of the explosion.
As it travels, it also propels small solid objects that happen to be caught in its path: pebbles, bits of the explosive’s outer casing, or pieces of anything that was in contact with the explosion.

 In game terms, every explosive device has a Damage trait.
 This functions in the same manner as the Damage trait of any other weapon: it injures or damages the victim of a successful attack (or the character or object who’s in direct physical contact with it when it detonates).
Three additional traits model the secondary effects that radiate out from the point of impact: Radius, Blast, and Fragmentation Density (abbreviated “Frag”).
Explosive devices do not have separate Penetration values.
The Penetration of any explosive against its primary target is always x1, and the Penetration of blast and fragmentation effects are discussed in the following sections.
 
 Example (Part 1): A high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead for an RPG-7 rocket launcher has Damage 80, Radius 4m, Blast 4, and Frag 2.
These values are all important because an enemy has just fired such a round into the side of the vehicle from which Ed, Keith, and Pete are emerging, attacking with a margin of suc- cess of 3.
The vehicle is the primary target of the successful at- tack, so it suffers normal damage: Damage 80 plus MoS 3, for a total damage value of 83.
This is applied to the vehicle’s Armor with Penetration x1.

## Radius
An explosion’s Radius defines the distance within which it does its greatest damage: its primary radius.
The explosion inflicts lesser effects within twice this distance, or its secondary radius.
 The concussive and fragmentation effects that occur within these radii are, respectively, primary effects and secondary effects.
If a victim is exactly on the border between primary and secondary effects, assume secondary effects apply.
 
 Example (Part 2): The RPG-7 warhead has a 4-meter Radius.
 Pete has just exited the vehicle and is one meter away from the point of impact; he suffers primary effects.
Keith has taken cover six meters away; he suffers secondary effects.
Ed has moved 11 meters away and is outside the secondary radius, so he is pelted with debris but suffers no mechanical effects.

 If a target with multiple hit locations (e.g.
 a PC, star NPC, or vehicle) suffers a direct hit from an explosive, the primary effects also apply to every hit location except the location that took the direct hit.
That location is in enough trouble already.

## Blast
An explosive’s Blast value represents the force of the shock wave that radiates out from its point of detonation.
It is roughly equivalent to a Damage value.
## Primary Blast Effects
Every target within an explosive’s primary radius suffers damage equal to the Blast value plus the attack’s margin of success.
For targets with multiple hit locations (PCs, star NPCs, and vehicles), this damage is applied separately to every location that is exposed to the blast.
Primary blast damage has Penetration x2.

## Secondary Blast Effects
Every target within an explosive’s secondary radius suffers damage equal to half the primary blast damage.
Secondary blast damage has Penetration x3.

Example (Part 3): The RPG-7 warhead has Blast 4 and the attack succeeded with a margin of success of 3, for a total blast damage of 7.
Pete suffers primary blast damage: a separate Damage 7 hit to each hit location, with Penetration x2.
Keith suffers secondary blast damage: a separate Damage 4 hit to each hit location, with Penetration x3.
The vehicle also suffers primary blast damage to each location except the one that took the direct hit.

## Fragmentation Density
Every explosion that occurs outside a sterile environment raises a cloud of smoke and dust.
An explosion’s Frag value provides a rough definition of the amount of potentially lethal solid shrapnel that’s also in the air in the instants after detonation.
 Unlike blast, which is a constant pressure wave, fragmentation is random in its devastation.
Some potential victims may be shredded by multiple hits while others are left unscathed.
Roll hit location separately for each fragment hit.

## Primary Frag Effects
For each potential target within the primary radius, roll a number of d10s equal to the explosion’s Frag.
Each die that comes up 6 or more is a lucky break.
Each die that comes up 5 or less is a fragment hit.
Primary fragments have Damage 6 and Penetration x2.
The die result serves as the margin of success for this “attack.” 
## Secondary Frag Effects
For each potential target within the secondary radius, roll a number of d20s equal to the explosion’s Frag.
=======
The die result serves as the margin of success for this “attack.
” Secondary Frag Effects For each potential target within the secondary radius, roll a number of d20s equal to the explosion’s Frag.
Each die that comes up 6 or more is a lucky break.
Each die that comes up 5 or less is a fragment hit.
Secondary fragments have Damage 4 and Penetration Nil.

Example (Part 4): The RPG-7 warhead has Fragmentation Density 2 (fairly low because it’s a shaped charge, not an anti- personnel round).
Pete suffers primary fragmentation effects, so the GM rolls 2d10.
The dice come up 1 and 5, indicating two hits.
For each hit, the die result (1 and 5) is added to the base Damage 6.
Pete takes a Damage 7 hit and a Damage 11 hit, both with Penetration x2.

 The vehicle also suffers primary fragmentation damage.
 
 Keith suffers secondary fragmentation effects, so the GM rolls 2d20.
The dice come up 4 and 18, indicating one hit, whose base damage is 4.
Keith takes a single hit with Damage 8 and Pen- etration Nil.

## Explosive Effects Summary 
The following table summarizes how the various traits of an explosion interact.

 Table 5k: Explosive Calculations 
 
 ## Characters and Explosions
  Characters will not often be the direct targets of explosive ordnance.
The Damage values of most warheads in the game are “tuned” to reflect their performance against vehicles and other hard targets.
If a character is unfortunate enough to sustain a direct hit from a large-caliber HE or HEAT round, his survival is not plausible, regardless of how the numbers work out.
The GM should exercise a balance of common sense and mercy, depending on how cinematic or bloodily realistic he wants his game to be.

# passive hazards

## Fire 
All animals share an instinctive dread of fire; man is no exception.
Open flame (or a source of equivalent temperature, such as molten metal) is a passive hazard.
The Damage of fire depends on its temperature, while the Avoidance Check is a CUF check whose difficulty is determined by the size of the fire: 

Flame Source Fire has Penetration x½ against body armor and other protective gear and Penetration x2 against structures and vehicles.
 Note that this rule only accurately models brief exposure.
If an item suffers extended exposure to fire, apply common sense over rules.

## Ignition
Given sufficient fuel and oxygen, fire spreads.
A character or object that sustains damage from fire has a chance of catching fire itself

## Fire-Based Attacks
Fire is considered a “normal” attack if a character directs it against a target as a projectile or close combat weapon.
The most common means of making such an attacks are flamethrowers and burning objects.
In such an event, the initial attack is resolved normally, using an appropriate skill check and the weapon’s Damage value.
However, if the target suffers damage from such a source, there is a chance it ignites using the rules given above.
 Once the initial attack is resolved, all further damage from being on fire is handled as a passive hazard.
 
## Impact 
A sufficient magnitude of blunt trauma can be as lethal as a blade or a bullet.
Close combat weapons are the most likely source of such injuries, but PCs also have a distressing propensity for falling from high places or throwing themselves in front of moving vehicles.
Damage from such causes, as well as other sources of wide-area kinetic energy transfer, is collectively referred to as impact damage.
 If a character falls, the distance in meters equals the Damage value of the impact.
Increase this value by 1 if the character is moderately encumbered, by 2 if he’s heavily encumbered, or by 4 if he’s overloaded.
If a character is struck by a moving vehicle, add the vehicle’s weight in tons to its speed in kilometers per hour and divide by 10 to determine the collision’s Damage value.
 Against rigid armor – scenery, vehicles, and such – impact has Penetration x1.
Against soft body armor and helmets, it has Penetration x2, reflecting the fact that padding provides superior protection (and, in fact, is often specifically designed to mitigate impacts).
 The avoidance check for impact is always a Coordination attribute check.
This check starts at standard TN but suffers a cumulative -1 penalty per meter fallen or per 10kph of closing speed.
The effects of a failed avoidance check differ slightly from the norm.
Instead of increasing the impact’s Damage, the margin of failure increases the extent of the damage.
A failed avoidance check results in a number of separate hits equal to the margin of failure.
 Example: Pete falls from an 8-meter cliff while heavily loaded.
 He suffers a –8 penalty to his avoidance check and fails it by 5.
 Pete suffers five hits, each with Damage 10 (8 meters, +2 for a heavy load).

## Drowning and Suffocation
A character without breathable air has only a limited amount of time before he loses consciousness from hypoxia.
These rules assume that such a character is interested in self-preservation and will attempt to hold his breath as long as possible rather than inhaling water, chlorine gas, or the pillow that his estranged wife is holding over his face.
Accordingly, when a character is deprived of oxygen, make a Fitness check.
Half the margin of success is the number of exchanges of fire and pauses (or minutes, outside combat) that the character can hold his breath before he begins suffering from oxygen deprivation.
With a margin of success of zero, ill effects begin at the end of the current exchange of fire or pause.
If the character has time to prepare by hyperventilating or otherwise increasing his blood oxygenation, apply a +4 bonus to the Fitness check.

 Once oxygen deprivation sets in, the character receives a slight virtual head injury.
This virtual injury becomes one stage worse after each subsequent exchange of fire or pause (or minute).
 Once this injury becomes critical, the character goes unconscious.
 One exchange of fire or pause (or minute) later, he dies.
At any point before death, returning the character to an environment in which he can breathe reduces the severity of the virtual head injury to slight.
This virtual injury is healed, and an unconscious character regains consciousness, after five minutes of rest.
 
 The same rules apply to a character who attempts to hold his breath in the face of an airborne hazard.
In this case, rather than suffering from oxygen deprivation, a character who runs out of air must breathe and becomes subject to whatever is in the air he’s now breathing.

## Gas Behavior
The most likely airborne hazards that characters will encounter are chemical weapons, whether riot control agents or more lethal substances.
Most chemical weapons are deployed via a grenade or warhead that emits a cloud of its contents upon detonation.
The initial cloud has a radius equal to the weapon’s listed burst radius and comes into existence upon detonation.
 At the beginning of each subsequent exchange of fire or pause, the cloud extends downwind an additional distance equal to its diameter, for a number of exchanges of fire or pauses determined by the current wind speed: Wind Speed 0
 
  Table 5m: Gas Dispersion Duration
 A gas cloud disperses at the end of the exchange of fire on which its dispersion duration expires (so in a major storm, a gas cloud vanishes at the end of the exchange of fire during which it appears).
 
 If a gaseous agent is deployed in an enclosed environment without appreciable wind, it spreads to twice its original radius in all directions, then disperses after 1d6 minutes.
 
# surprise
 ”Surprise is an event that occurs in the mind of the commander,” states an ancient military maxim.
In the Reflex System,surpriseis an effect that occurs in the mind of any character who isn’t psychologically prepared when combat begins.

The default initiative rules assume that all involved parties have at least a few seconds’ warning that they are about to exchange punches or bullets.
This can happen when two opposing forces become aware of each other simultaneously, or when a less hostile social interaction begins to obviously break down into imminent violence.
Regardless of the precise circumstances, everyone knows the fight is coming and has the opportunity to make the mental shift into a fighting mindset.
When one or more characters don’t have this advance warning, they are surprised.

## mutual surprise
Mutual surprise occurs when two opposing groups that were previously unprepared for combat suddenly encounter one another and choose to initiate hostilities.
In this case, every participant starts on equal footing, so the standard initiative rules apply.

## ambush 
An ambush is asymmetrical surprise - some participants know they’re about to be in a fight, but others don’t.
In this case, the combatants with foreknowledge have a distinct advantage.
They can, at least to a limited extent, choose the time and location at which combat begins.
An ambush can be planned well in advance, or it can be an impromptu tactical decision based on only a few seconds’ warning.
## Setting an Ambush 
To prepare an ambush, the participant leading the effort makes a Tactics (COG) check which the target will oppose after the fact.
This check suffers a cumulative –1 penalty for every vehicle involved in the ambush, as well as every intended attacker who is Unskilled in Tactics.
Preparing an ambush requires one minute per participant in the attack.
All characters in the crew positions of a single vehicle count as one participant for this purpose.

 Example: Ed is leading Simon, Justin, and Leslie on a patrol when he receives a report that an enemy squad is moving in their direction.
Ed decides to prepare an ambush at a nearby bridge; he and Simon will dismount and use their personal weap- ons, while Justin and Leslie will stay in the gunner’s and driver’s positions of the team’s HMMWV.
This ambush will involve two independent attackers and one vehicle crew, so setup takes three minutes.
Ed makes a Tactics (COG) check, suffering a -1 penalty for the one involved vehicle.
None of his group is Unskilled in Tactics, so he suffers no additional penalty for ambushers who need extra supervision.

## Detecting an Ambush 
As a target approaches an ambush site, he receives one chance to detect the ambush.
Unless he is specifically watching for an attack, this is an Awareness check that opposes the ambusher’s earlier Tactics (COG) check.
With success, the target becomes aware of the ambush immediately before combat begins and is not surprised.

 If the prospective victim is actively scanning for an ambush, he may make a Tactics (AWA) check which opposes the ambusher’s earlier check.
With success, he identifies the ambush with enough advance warning that he can decide whether to enter it (and thus begin combat normally, with no surprise) or avoid it entirely.
 In either case, noticing an ambush involves visual perception and thereby is subject to any environmental or other limitations on vision.
## Effects of Surprise
If the target of an ambush fails to notice it, he is surprised.
 His base initiative value for the first exchange of fire is considered zero, though he still makes his initiative check normally.
In addition, being ambushed has morale effects (see p. 159).
After the first exchange of fire, a surviving ambush victim acts according to the normal initiative rules.

## Ambush Variations 
The basic ambush rules define the creation of a classic ambush in the military sense: one group of combatants establishes prepared, concealed positions and waits for an enemy group to enter the kill zone.
However, variants on this theme are certainly feasible.
A comprehensive examination of the principles and techniques of tactical surprise would require a book at least as large as this one.
Accordingly, we can’t cover every possibility here, and the GM is advised to use his own discretion in arbitrating players’ ingenious plans for creative ambushes.
Two prototypical alternate tactics are discussed below.

## Social Ambushes 
Not all ambushes revolve around conventional military action.
A meeting with an arms dealer in a dockside tavern can be a setup for a robbery attempt.
Obtaining an invitation to a warlord’s private party may be easier than staging a frontal assault on his fortress.
In such situations, prospective attackers may need to surprise targets via face-to-face interaction rather than camouflage and IEDs.
Social ambush attempts are variations on diverting the target’s attention so he doesn’t recognize the impending threat until he feels the knife slip between his ribs.
 To plan and execute a social ambush, the ambush leader makes a Deception (COG) skill check, rather than a Tactics (COG) check.
This check suffers a cumulative -1 penalty for every additional participant in the ambush.
Each participant who is Unskilled in Deception inflicts an additional -1.
 Detecting a social ambush requires a Personality check for a causal observer or a Tactics (PER) check for a defender who’s actively scanning for threats.
## Maneuver Ambushes 
In a maneuver ambush, the attacker moves into a position of tactical advantage, rather than waiting for the target to come to him.
Stealthy movement, as opposed to simple stationary camouflage, is a key component of a maneuver ambush.
 Accordingly, the ambusher uses the lower of his Tactics or Fieldcraft skill ratings to enact this ambush.
 If making a Fieldcraft check, he suffers a cumulative –1 penalty for every participant who is Unskilled in that skill, as well as a cumulative –1 penalty for every motorized vehicle involved in the ambush.
 If a maneuver ambush occurs in an urban, rather than wilderness, environment, substitute Streetcraft for Fieldcraft.
# morale and threats
A Hollywood hero never succumbs to fear.
Regardless of the odds arrayed against him, he sets his square jaw and fixes his steely gaze upon the hordes of enemies.
In the Reflex System, however, characters are a bit more human.
The following rules model the conditions under which a character’s courage can fail him, reducing his combat effectiveness and ultimately robbing him of his will to fight.

 A character’s morale condition is determined by two factors: his Coolness Under Fire value and the current threat level arrayed against him.
Various threat conditions represent events or injuries that can negatively affect a combatant’s morale.
 The character’s threat level is equal to the total number of threat conditions that apply to him during the current combat scene.
 As long as his threat level is less than or equal to his CUF, he suffers no adverse effects.
He’s sufficiently hardened that the bullets, bombs, and blood don’t faze him.
However, if his threat level exceeds his CUF, he suffers a penalty on all checks equal to the difference between threat level and CUF.
If the difference is 5 or more, his will to fight is broken and he’s unable to take any actions other than fleeing, performing first aid on himself, communicating, and curling into a fetal ball and weeping.
At the end of each exchange of fire, he may not press - he must hold.
 Furthermore, a broken character automatically fails all opposed and competing social checks.

 Example: Leslie has CUF 8.
As long as her threat level is 8 or less, she suffers no morale-related penalties.
If her threat level increases to 11, she suffers a -3 penalty on all checks.
If her threat level increases to 13 or higher, she becomes broken, un- able to carry on the fight due to a total morale failure.

# threat conditions [stopped here]
The following list of threat conditions represents the most common battlefield threats that can affect morale.
At the GM’s discretion, factors not described here can also be threat conditions.
 Note that some threat conditions are subjective; as always, the GM’s interpretation is final.
 
 Basic Threats 
 •combat is occurring 
 •character has been attacked 
 •character has been attacked with lethal force
  •enemy is using automatic weapons (burst fire)
   •enemy is using explosives 
   •enemy is using incendiary weapons 
   •enemy is obviously irrational/insane (rabid, psychotic, on meth, etc.
) 
•enemy is charging and is (a) mounted, (b) in a vehicle, or (c) an animal larger than human size Tactical Considerations 
•ambushed (no advance warning)
• fighting in darkness (night-vision gear negates this condition) 
•character and allies are outnumbered 2:1 or more
•character can’t see enemy •character has no weapon that can reach or harm enemy 
•enemy has clearly superior position (high ground, prepared fighting positions)
•enemy has clearly superior armament 
•enemy has clearly superior mobility
•escape is impossible (fight or die) 

## Injuries
A character’s most severe injury (or virtual injury) adds to his threat condition.
Each level of injury counts as one threat condition.
Thus, if a character has two slight injuries, a moderate injury, and two serious injuries, only the worst injury level - serious - applies to morale, and it counts as three threat conditions.

## Casualties
As allies go down, the odds look worse.
The first friendly casualty counts as one threat condition.
For purposes of this rule, a casualty is critically injured, unconscious, dead, or broken.
Every additional 25% losses counts as an additional threat condition.
 In addition, if the character is in a team (see p. 131) and the team’s leader becomes a casualty, that loss counts as yet another threat condition.
## Lifesaving 
Having someone else’s life literally in your hands is stressful under any circumstances.
Accordingly, whenever a character is performing first aid or surgery on someone else, the patient’s most serious injury level generates threat conditions in the same manner as injuries to the caregiver himself.
Thus, attempting to stabilize a critically-injured victim counts as four threat conditions.
These threat conditions persists until treatment is successful, at which time they vanish.

If a character treats multiple patients over the course of a single scene, only the worst lifesaving threat condition applies.

Example: Leslie’s band of survivors is ambushed by a large group of well-armed opponents.
She sustains a moderate injury in the initial volley of machine gun and RPG fire.
Leslie’s initial threat conditions are substantial: she’s in combat (1), she’s been personally attacked (1), the enemy is using both automatic weap- ons and explosives (2), she’s been ambushed (1), and she’s mod- erately injured (2).
 Her threat level is now 7.
 With her CUF of 8, she’s not yet subject to morale penalties, but she will be if the fight gets much worse.
 
## Extreme Threats
   Some threats are sufficiently overawing as to be outside the normal scope of sanity.
Accordingly, they are likely to count as more than one threat condition.

## Personal Fears
Characters with the Aversion and Phobia disadvantages are rattled whenever they confront the objects of their fears.
 Whenever a character encounters the subject of an aversion, roll 2d6L to determine the number of threat conditions that it represents for the current scene.
Whenever a character encounters the subject of a phobia, roll 2d6H.
 
 Inaddition,self-inflictedmoralviolationscanbedemoralizing.
 Breaking the conditions of a Code disadvantage counts as 1d6 threat conditions.
 
## WMDs 
Nuclear, biological, and chemical hazards are never cuddly, but survivors of the Last Year view them with particular horror, having likely seen their effects firsthand.
The mere hazard of exposure to a WMD or an equally lethal non-weapon hazard (avian influenza, industrial chlorine gas leak) qualifies as 1d6 threat conditions.
Actual exposure qualifies as 2d10H threat conditions, replacing the lesser threat condition for the hazard.
 Protective gear appropriate to a threat reduces these values to 1 and 2d6L, respectively.

 If the threat is of a general type but less than full weapon- grade exposure (year-old fallout, cholera, industrial runoff), the hazard is a single threat condition and actual exposure is 2d6L threat conditions.
Appropriate protective gear negates these threat conditions entirely.
## Horrifying Experiences
Although most survivors have seen their share of bad things by 2013, some sights can still rattle them.
At the GM’s discretion, witnessing or finding evidence of tragedies or atrocities can qualify as anywhere from 1 to 2d10H threat conditions.
The GM should maintain a sense of perspective, using the rules here as guidelines for the relative shock and horror of a given event.

## Suppressive Fire
Most attacks are made with a definite target in mind – randomly spraying bullets downrange is unlikely to neutralize any enemies.
However, some situations call for controlled fire into an empty area in order to discourage opponents from moving through it or otherwise doing anything that might make them targets.
This technique is known as suppressive fire.
Any firearm can be used for suppressive fire.

 Suppressive fire requires a snap shot Attack action, targeting an area rather than an enemy.
The maximum width of area that can be suppressed is equal to half the number of bullets being fired in meters (e.g.
 a three-round burst can suppress an area up to one and a half meters wide).
Using a single shot or a short burst (5 rounds or less) gives an area an effective threat rating of 1.
A long burst (5 or more rounds) gives it a threat rating of 2.
Using explosives or tracer ammunition increases the threat rating by 1 (the incoming fire is visible in this case, not just audible).
 
 If a character takes an action that places him within the suppressed area and exposes him to the source of the suppressive fire, his current threat level increases by the suppressed area’s threat rating.
This lasts until the end of the current exchange of fire.
If he exposes himself before the attacker’s next action, the attacker also gets a “free shot” on him, using the same rate of fire that he used for the suppression.
This action has a tick cost of zero and is resolved before the suppressed character’s action is resolved.

 Example: Keith is using his Minimi (ROF B5/B9) to suppress two enemies who are behind an armored bunker door.
Keith hos- es bullets into the door at his gun’s high rate of fire, laying down a 9-round burst.
The Minimi’s ammo mix includes tracer rounds, so anyone who sticks his head out of the door before the end of the exchange of fire will suffer a +3 increase to his threat level.

 The bunker door is too thick for the Minimi to penetrate, so the enemy troops aren’t initially exposed to the fire.
However, before Keith’s next action, one of the enemies opens the door to throw a grenade at Keith.
As he exposes himself to the suppressive fire, his threat level immediately increases by 3.
Keith takes his free at- tack on the exposed enemy, putting down another 9-round burst - and his target.
 
 Keith’s next action is to reload.
While Keith is reloading, the sec- ond enemy takes the opportunity to run out of the bunker toward Keith’s position.
This also exposes him to Keith, raising this en- emy’s threat level by 3 as well.
However, Keith is no longer en- gaged in suppressing the same spot, so he doesn’t get a free attack on the second target.

## Intimidation
The Intimidation skill is a means of implicitly or explicitly threatening a subject.
This only works outside of combat; verbal threats aren’t effective when bullets are already flying around.
 Intimidating someone verbally (or silently) requires five minutes and an Intimidation (RES) check, while a physical display requires one minute and an Intimidation (MUS) check.
The margin of success is the number of threat conditions that the character presents, compared to the subject’s RES rather than his CUF.
This is an exception to the general rule that morale applies only during combat.
 
 Example: Leslie needs information from a prisoner and doesn’t have time to waste.
She decides to start playing with knives while describing her plans in an ominous monotone.
The GM decides that this is primarily psychological despite the blades, so Leslie makes an Intimidation (RES) check.
Her margin of suc- cess is 9, so she presents 9 threat conditions to her prisoner.

Leslie has two teammates in the room to help restrain the pris- oner, with more guards outside the locked door.
The GM decides that these conditions count as “outnumbered 2:1 or more,” “un- able to harm enemy,” and “escape is impossible,” so the total threat level that Leslie presents is 12.
This easily exceeds the prisoner’s RES of 6.
In fact, it exceeds his RES by more than 5, so he breaks.
As a broken character automatically fails all opposed social checks, he’s unable to further resist Leslie’s ques- tioning.

## morale boosts
Various actions and effects can temporarily increase a character’s effective CUF.

## Tango Down
Whenever a character’s action decisively removes a threat (killed, unconscious, or otherwise rendered incapable of any further aggression), his CUF is increased by 1 for the duration of the combat scene.
  This is cumulative up to a maximum of +3.
If a character’s Code disadvantage forbids killing under the current circumstances, this bonus instead becomes a penalty.

## Panic Fire
There’s something innately reassuring about making noise, even if nothing gets hit.
As his first action during an exchange of fire, a character whose current threat level exceeds his CUF may make a hip shot with any firearm or explosive weapon he’s currently wielding, using its highest possible rate of fire.
This hip shot has no declared attack and no chance of doing damage (though explosives may still deviate into uncomfortable places at the GM’s cruel whim).
However, for the remainder of the exchange of fire, the character’s CUF is increased by half the number of bullets fired or half the explosion’s Radius (whichever is greater, if the character is using an automatic weapon with explosive ammunition).

## Sweet, Sweet Morphine 
An injection of one unit of strong pain reliever eliminates the threat conditions caused by serious or lesser injuries (though not the wound penalties).
Critical injuries are traumatic and obvious enough to inflict their full four threat conditions even through a morphine haze.

## You Wanna Live Forever?
A character can use the Command skill to bolster an ally’s morale.
This requires a 3-tick Communicate tactical action for a short (and hopefully inspirational) phrase, along with a Command (RES) skill check.
With success, the target’s CUF is increased by the margin of success (minimum +1) until the next pause.
If a character is the target of multiple such actions, only the most recent one applies.
## Teamwork 
Acting as part of a team (see p. 131) innately increases a character’s CUF.

# stage iii combat options 
The rest of this chapter provides rules of increased complexity, realism, and lethality for those play groups who want to use the Reflex System more like a wargame for small unit combat.

## advanced combat timing
The Reflex System’s basic initiative and action rules accept a significant fallacy: the conceit that an action is resolved on the tick on which it begins, not the tick on which it ends.

Example: Ed and Boris are both acting on Tick 10.
They have identical weapons, with which they attack each other.
Ed choos- es a hip shot (tick cost 3), while Boris chooses an aimed shot (tick cost 8).
Despite the aimed shot actually requiring significantly more time, both attacks are resolved simultaneously.
This ne- gates any speed advantage that Ed might have hoped to receive from his hip shot.

 The reason that the rules are written this way is ease of play.
In our original draft, each action was resolved on its last tick, not its first tick.
We found that most play groups had difficulty with the focused attention necessary to declare an action, not resolve it immediately, wait a few minutes of play time while resolving previous actions, and then remember to resolve the action that had been left hanging.
 
 With this said, we do recognize that players with a strong tactical focus may prefer the more realistic and precise mechanism of resolving actions as they end.
To streamline this process, it may help to have a dry-erase board or other tracking mechanism so that everyone can easily see when his current action is up for resolution.

This resolution mechanism introduces the potential for an action to be interrupted before it’s complete.
If this happens, the acting character effectively loses the action, paying its tick cost and waiting until the end of the interrupted action to begin a new one.

 Example: Ed and Boris are both acting on Tick 10.
They have identical weapons, with which they attack each other.
 Ed chooses a hip shot (tick cost 3), while Boris chooses an aimed shot (tick cost 8).
With a cost of 3, Ed’s hip shot will end on Tick 7; by contrast, Boris’ aimed shot will end on Tick 2.
Ed’s hip shot therefore is the first action to resolve.
 It misses.
On Tick 7, Ed fires another hip shot, hoping to throw off Boris’ aim.
This second hip shot will end on Tick 4, which means it still will be resolved before Boris’ aimed shot is resolved.
Ed’s second hip shot strikes Boris in the arm, inflicting a serious injury.
Boris, still in the process of aiming, drops his gun.
He will be able to act again on Tick 2, which is when the interrupted action would have ended and been resolved.

# armor
Armor Degradation Once a few high-velocity projectiles have blown through it, armor loses some of its effectiveness.
A piece of armor is penetrated whenever the raw Damage of the attack - without applying the attack’s margin of success - exceeds the Penetration-modified Armor value.
Each normal impact (close combat or solid projectile) that penetrates armor reduces its value by 1.
Each explosion or fire that penetrates armor reduces its value by half the amount of damage that penetrated.
 Example: A tank suffers a near-miss from an artillery shell.
After Armor reduces the incoming Damage, the tank still receives 13 damage from the blast to the left side of its hull.
The tank’s left hull facing has its Armor value reduced by half the penetrating damage, or 7.

## assistant gunners Military doctrine calls for an assistant gunner to be assigned to most support weapons or belt-fed weapons.
This is because the care and feeding of such armament goes faster with more than two hands.
An adjacent character can take one of the two actions required to reload a belt-fed or heavy weapon.
If he’s carrying the ammo himself, he can also take responsibility for having it to hand as soon as the gunner needs it, thereby saving the gunner any action necessary to ready it.
 
## explosions

## Knockdown 
The concept of bullet impacts knocking victims flat is a cinematic myth, but the distribution of explosive force across a character’s whole body is another thing entirely.
When a character suffers blast damage, the player must make a Muscle check with a penalty equal to half the final damage value.
If this check fails, the blast knocks the character prone.
## Confined Spaces
If an explosion occurs in an enclosed space with walls strong enough to resist its force, the shock wave rebounds within that space, likely striking all targets multiple times within a fraction of a second.
This is known as the “chunky salsa effect” for reasons which should be obvious to any reader with an active imagination (thank you, FASA).

Shock waves tend to follow the path of least resistance whenever one exists.
If an explosion occurs within a space that is less than twice its Radius in only one or two dimensions, extend its Radius by an amount equal to the lack of space.
For example, in a two-meter-wide hallway, an explosion with a 5m Radius is missing eight meters of normal expansion room.
Therefore, its Radius is extended from 5m to 13m.

 If the explosion occurs within a totally enclosed space that is less than twice its Radius in its longest dimension, compare the Blast of the explosion to the Armor value of the space’s weakest surface.
If the Blast is greater, the structure partially contains the blast before giving way: double the Blast and Frag values applied against all targets within the space.
 If the Armor is equal or greater, the structure totally contains the explosion: multiply the Blast and Frag values by four.

## handedness
Between 85% and 92% of adults favor their right hands as dominant.
Going by the statistics, unless a player specifies at character creation that his character is left-handed, he is assumed to be right-handed.
This detail is important in the Reflex System because the use of a hit location table allows for the possibility of injury to the dominant arm.
Sufficiently debilitating injuries may leave the character with no choice but to perform some actions - such as defending himself from further injury - with his non- dominant hand.

 Whenever a character attempts to use his non-dominant hand as the primary hand for any action, he suffers a –2 penalty, increased to –4 if the action requires fine motor control.
The Ambidexterity advantage (see p. 122) can eliminate this penalty for certain specific tasks.

If a character suffers a permanent impairment to his dominant hand, he may transition to using his non-dominant hand as his dominant hand with extensive daily practice.
In such an event, every 2 months of game time reduce the penalty by 1 (thus, 10 months after losing his right hand, a formerly right-handed character is fully left-handed).

## One-Handed Actions
Some actions require the character to use two hands.
These include (but are not limited to) attacks with two-handed weapons and vehicle maneuvers.
Whenever a character attempts a two- handed action with only one hand, he suffers a –3 penalty.
This is cumulative with the penalty from use of the non-dominant hand (above).
At the GM’s discretion, some actions, such as attacking with a bow or an ATGM, may be entirely impossible without the leverage that two hands provide.
## Two-Gun Mojo 
Thanks to Hollywood, some players may have a vastly inflated idea of their characters’ ability to simultaneously fire two guns with unerring accuracy.
In the somewhat harsher reality of the Reflex System, this tactic is useful for blindly spraying suppressive fire, but not very cost-effective.

 A character with a one-handed firearm in each hand may attack with both guns simultaneously.
Because it’s impossible to achieve a sight picture with both weapons, the character may only make hip shots.
The player makes a separate attack check for each weapon.
If both attacks are directed at the same target, each suffers a –2 penalty; if two different victims are targeted, this penalty increases to –4.
In addition, standard penalties for use of the non-dominant hand apply.

## Long and Short 
Unlike marksmanship, close combat with hand weapons often relies on the use of twin or irregularly paired implements for both attack and defense.
Accordingly, a character wielding a one-handed close combat weapon in each hand has a much easier time than a two-gun shooter if he has the proper training – in this case, the Ambidexterity (Hand Weapons) advantage.
Without this advantage, none of the following bonuses apply.

 A character with a one-handed close combat weapon in his off hand uses it primarily for defense.
This translates into more effective Block actions.
Any Block action receives a bonus equal to 1 plus the off-hand weapon’s Bulk.
 
 An off-hand weapon also enables the wielder to make coordinated attacks.
This isn’t a simultaneous double strike, but rather a use of the off-hand weapon to knock aside the target’s defenses before striking with the primary weapon.
 Such an attack receives a bonus equal to 1 plus the off-hand weapon’s Bulk.

## Twin Fists of Fury
Most martial arts attempt to minimize a fighter’s reliance on his dominant hand by teachingstrikes, parries, and other maneuvers with all available limbs.
With the Reflex System’s abstraction of close combat attacks, it’s safe to assume that a character is making a full-body effort to maneuver, defend, and attack.
 No off-hand penalty applies to unarmed combat actions.
 If a character has injuries to one or both arms, use the lesser wound penalty to unarmed actions.
 
## indirect fire
Indirect fire is a ranged attack at a target that the attacker can’t himself see, which requires a weapon with the Indirect Fire Range (IFR) trait.
In order to know that he needs to attack something rather than just blindly lobbing projectiles over intervening terrain features, he needs guidance.
This guidance comes from another character who can directly observe the target (a forward observer).

 To initiate indirect fire, the forward observer must call for fire.
This requires a Communicate (Complex) operational action and a successful skill check - either Artillery (COG, TN +2) or Tactics (COG).
With success, the forward observer provides the attacker enough useful information to set up the first shot.
 
 Once the attacker has received a successful call for fire, he can make his first attack, provided that the target is within his weapon’s IFR.
This attack uses the appropriate weapon skill, typically Artillery, and is an operational action rather than a standard attack tactical action.
The base attribute is always Cognition.
The attack check suffers a penalty equal to 15 minus the forward observer’s margin of success (minimum penalty -5).
 This extremely high penalty means that most indirect fire attacks will deviate as described in the following section.
 
 Indirect fire lands at the end of the exchange of fire or pause in which it was fired.
Thus, the round detonates after all Tick 1 actions or operational actions have been resolved.

### Deviation
The trajectory of indirect fire means that projectiles will impact the ground somewhere in the area of combat.
As indirect fire usually involves explosive warheads, there is a chance that even a failed attack will still result in a round landing close enough to a target – if not necessarily the intended one – to inflict damage.
 When an indirect fire attack fails, it therefore deviates from its intended point of impact.
 
 To determine the direction in which a miss deviates, roll 1d10 and consult the deviation diagram shown here.
The vertical arrow indicates the direction of the attack.
Thus, a die result of 1 or 2 indicates that from the attacker’s perspective, the miss lands directly behind the target, and on a 6 or 7, the miss lands on a direct line between the attacker and the target.

 The distance by which a miss deviates is dependent on how badly the attacker missed and how far away the target is.
Multiple*  the margin of failure by a factor determined by the range band of the attack, as follows: 
Range Band 

## Adjusting Fire 
Once an attacker has received an initial call for fire, he can continue to make indirect fire attacks at the same target, subject to the same penalty as the initial attack.
However, this doesn’t gain him any accuracy.
The role of the forward observer at this point is to adjust the incoming fire by telling the attacker where his shots are landing so he can correct his aim.

 Adjusting fire is a Communicate (Simple) tactical action with a tick cost of 5 ticks, which a forward observer can undertake once per exchange of fire after observing the impact of the last indirect fire attack.
Each action requires the same skill check as a call for fire: the forward observer’s choice of Artillery (COG, TN +2) or Tactics (COG).
With success, the attacker’s penalty for indirect fire is reduced by 1 (with a MoS of 5 or more, the penalty is reduced by 2).
This reduction is cumulative for multiple adjustments, though it can never reduce this penalty below -5.

### Changing Targets
A forward observer can shift an attacker’s fire to a different target once indirect fire is under way.
The amount of information necessary requires another call for fire.
However, the effects of any adjustments are not lost.
## Self-Observed Fire
If a character is within visual range of his target (see p. 74), he doesn’t need a forward observer or a call for fire, so long as he knows where he’s shooting.
For example, if an enemy platoon runs behind an office building that a mortarman can see, he doesn’t need someone else to tell him where to fire.
A character with a bow, crossbow, or thrown weapon can also use self-observed fire (though in the case of non-explosive projectiles, the likelihood of the direct hit required to inflict damage is vanishingly small).
 When a character uses self-observed fire, the attack check’s penalty begins at -10 and decreases by 2 for each subsequent indirect fire attack on the same target, without a call for fire or adjustment being needed.
  There is no minimum penalty.
In addition, if the attacker is using a weapon with a normal Speed trait (such as a grenade launcher), the attack occurs as a normal attack action rather than an operational action.

# mines
A mine is an explosive and attached detonator that is left in place, usually concealed, until a passerby triggers it.
For game purposes, all such devices fall under these rules, whether they’re mass-produced in a factory or improvised in an insurgent’s goat shed.

## Emplacing a Mine 
For a mass-produced mine, emplacement is fairly straightforward.
While any explosive is innately dangerous, industrial quality control ensures that the user isn’t likely to blow himself up unless he errs catastrophically.
Putting a mine into position requires the player’s choice of a Construction/Demolition (CDN, TN +2) or Tactics (CDN) skill check.
This task takes three minutes for an antipersonnel (AP) mine or fifteen minutes for an antitank (AT) mine.
  Success leaves the mine armed.
Failure indicates that it’s still inert, but a margin of failure of 10 or more means that the character accidentally detonates the mine while attempting to emplace it.
 
 Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are much more prone to failure due to their irregular nature.
Emplacing an IED always requires a Construction/Demolition (CDN) skill check.
If the check fails, the GM rolls 1d10.
If the die result is less than or equal to the margin of failure, it’s time for a new character.
 
 In either case, it is assumed that the character emplacing the mine wants to conceal it so that enemies will blunder into it rather than detecting and avoiding it.
Accordingly, the margin of success on the skill check is opposed by the Awareness check of any subsequent observer.
At the GM’s discretion, particularly favorable or unfavorable terrain may modify the margin of success.
 If the character wants to leave the mine in the open, the skill check receives a +3 bonus and the time to emplace the mine is reduced to one-third normal.
 
## Detonating a Mine 
Most mines are rigged for one of two forms of detonation, based on their design.
Mines designed to be buried are detonated by pressure, such as the weight of a character’s footstep or a tank’s tread.
Mines intended for above-ground deployment, such as directional antipersonnel mines, are detonated via tripwire or another directional sensor system.
Both types may also have backup or anti-tamper sensors.

## Minefields
A minefield is a wide area in which multiple mines are emplaced.
Minefields typically provide area denial, preventing movement across specific areas.
If a character or vehicle passes through a minefield, there is a random chance of setting off a mine.
 This chance is based on the number of mines per 10 square meters of the field and the distance that the prospective victim travels through the field.

 Typical densities of minefields range from 0.
01 to 0.
04 mines per 10 square meters.
In other words, a low-density minefield will average one mine per 1,000 square meters, and a high- density minefield will average one mine per 250 square meters.
 To determine the chance that a traveler triggers a mine, multiply the minefield’s density by the distance in meters that he travels through the minefield, then roll percentile (for a character or mount) or 1d20 (for a vehicle).
If the die result is less than or equal to the chance of detonation, a mine is detonated.
Regardless of density and distance, a percentile result of 96+ or a d20 result of 20 always indicates safe passage.
 
 Example: Matt unwittingly drives his truck 200 meters across a minefield with a density of 0.
02.
  200 x 0.
02 equals 4.
Because Matt is in a vehicle, the GM rolls 1d20.
If the die result is a 4 or less, Matt will trigger a mine.

## Choke Points
Minefields are effective only if the owner has a large supply of mines to spread around.
For more limited inventories - such as those with which most PC groups will be operating - it’s more effective to emplace one or a handful of mines in a place through which an enemy is sure to pass.
Bridges, hallways, jungle trails, mountain passes, and city streets are all likely choke points in which an emplaced mine is vastly more likely to be detonated.

 When a mine is emplaced in a choke point, the GM should record the margin of success on the skill check to emplace it.
 Subsequently, whenever traffic sufficient to detonate the mine passes through the choke point, the GM rolls 1d20 for a pressure- detonated mine or 1d10 for a mine with a tripwire or directional sensor.
If the die result is less than or equal to the margin of success, the mine is detonated.
With a margin of success of zero, the mine still detonates on a die result of 1.

## Character Effects
When a character triggers a mine, he only suffers full blast damage to one leg (randomly determine right or left).
Each other body part suffers half blast damage.
Resolve fragmentation hits normally.

## Vehicle Effects
When a vehicle triggers a mine, it suffers full blast damage to its suspension and half blast damage to its hull rear facing.
If the mine is a shaped charge (i.
e.
 has a Direct Damage value), the vehicle instead suffers full blast damage to its suspension and full direct damage to its hull rear facing.
Resolve fragmentation hits normally, using rear armor values where appropriate.

## Command Detonation 
Some mines, particularly directional AP mines, are intended to be detonated by intentional command rather than accidental encounter.
If a mine is rigged for command detonation, it will not detonate until it receives the appropriate signal.
Depending on the precise system, this may be an electrical impulse carried through a wire, a coded radio signal, or even a burning fuse.
 Obviously, some form of observation is required in order to know when a target will be close enough to the mine for its detonation to have the desired effect.

To command-detonate a mine, a character must have the detonator ready.
Sending the detonation signal is a tactical action.
 For a mechanical or electronic system, this action costs 2 ticks and detonation is instantaneous.
For a fuse that must be lit, the action costs 5 ticks and detonation occurs 1 tick after the action (plus any time for the fuse to burn, if the character is using a time-delay fuse).

 A command-detonated mine is treated like a normal explosion, rather than one that automatically occurs in contact with the victim.
 Characters or vehicles suffer the effects listed above only if they are in contact with the mine when it explodes.
If the attacker tries to time the detonation so that it occurs precisely when a moving object passes over the mine, a CUF (TN -1) check is required.
 
## Marking Minefields
If a character is aware of a minefield’s presence (through either savvy observation or messy trial and error), he may attempt to map its boundaries or determine a safe route through it.
Either task requires an incremental Construction/Demolition (AWA, TN +2) skill check.
Maps or written notes from the party responsible for the minefield provide a +2 bonus.
In addition, if the character emplaced the minefield himself, he receives a +2 bonus.
Each check takes 10 minutes and marks a number of meters of route or boundary equal to the margin of success.
 Failure indicates that the character can’t be sure that his route or boundary is accurate and safe, while a margin of failure of 10 or more means that the character accidentally detonates a mine.

 GM Hint: Redirection  
 Anotheruse ofminefields isto redirect anenemy force,either to hamper its movement or to funnel it into a more advantageous killing zone.
Most minefields used for redirection are obvious - or set up to appear “poorly concealed” - as a deception tactic, drawing attention to the minefield and away from other threats.
 Mines used in this manner tend to be surface-deployed rather than buried.
 
 Redirection minefields are useful when a unit has a low supply of mines.
A redirection minefield can contain a low number of real mines on its borders, with fake mines adding apparent depth.
Once a minefield is spotted (or triggered), few commanders will be willing to probe to determine just how deep it is.

## Removing Mines 
The safest way to remove a mine is to detonate it in place or destroy it with an attack.
Deliberate triggering is left to the fiendish imagination of the players.
Destroying a mine follows the standard rules for damaging items (see p. 154).
A standard AP mine has Bulk 1, Armor 3, and a damage threshold of 4.
A standard AT mine has Bulk 3, Armor 4, and a damage threshold of 7.
There is a flat 50% chance that a mine will explode upon being disabled.
If it doesn’t detonate then, there is a flat 25% chance that it will detonate whenever it is moved.

Alternately, particularly brave or foolhardy characters may try to defuse a mine and recover it for their own use.
If the mine only has its normal detonator, this requires a Construction/Demolition (COG, TN -2) check and 10 minutes.

## Anti-Tamper 
Some mines are designed to detonate if an attempt is made to move them.
If a mine has an anti-tamper mechanism, a Construction/Demolition (AWA, TN -2) check is required to spot it.
 Once the technician is aware of the anti-tamper system, defusing the mine becomes an incremental Construction/Demolition (RES, TN -3) check with a 10-minute period and a target total determined by the sophistication of the mechanism.
On any disarming attempt, a margin of failure of 5 or more means it’s time to go back to Chapter Four.
Moving a mine with a live anti-tamper system results in detonation, even if a standard defusing attempt was “successful.”

# sustained fire
The basic rules for ranged attacks assume that every attack occurs on its own.
This is a deliberate simplification that ignores one fact of firearm use: it’s quicker to continue firing on the same target than to shift to a new one.
 
 Under this option, once a character has made a ranged attack against a target, all of his subsequent ranged attacks against the same target have their tick costs reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).
This bonus is not cumulative and applies only so long as the character is doing nothing other than attacking with the same weapon.
Any other action – including moving or reloading – removes this bonus; the character must then resume attacks in order to regain it.

In addition, if the character is firing bursts with tracer ammunition, every attack after the first that receives the bonus described above also receives a cumulative +1 bonus to the skill check.

 Example 1: Keith attacks a rabid bear with his shotgun.
The first attack is not considered sustained fire and receives no bonus.
 Keith then fires two more rounds; each of these attacks has its tick cost reduced by 1.
The bear is getting close at this point, so Keith now takes a movement action to walk backward while firing a fourth shot.
Even though Keith is still attacking, the movement action interrupts his sustained fire, so this fourth attack does not have its tick cost reduced.
 
 Example 2: Ed opens fire on an oncoming truck.
He’s using an M249 loaded with tracer ammo (maybe not the best anti-vehicu- lar weapon, but the best he had on hand at the time).
Ed fires four bursts in succession.
The first receives no sustained fire bonus.
 The second has its tick cost reduced by 1 and receives a +1 bonus from the tracers.
 The third has its tick cost reduced by 1 and re- ceives a +2 bonus.
The fourth has its tick cost reduced by 1 and receives a +3 bonus.
