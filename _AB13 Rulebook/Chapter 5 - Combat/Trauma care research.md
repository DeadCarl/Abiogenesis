**First aid** is the first and immediate assistance given to any person with either a minor or **serious** [illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness "Illness") or [injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury "Injury"),[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid#cite_note-1) with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery until medical services arrive.
```

## hospital care Definitive care and rehabilitation
Definitive care is a type of emergency medical care that aims to manage a patient's condition in a conclusive way.


# Origins
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_triad_of_death

```
In the early 1980s, R. Adam Cowley, a U.S. military surgeon popularized the term "golden hour," words often used in trauma and emergency medicine settings. The term's origins lie in photography and reference the first hour of light after the sun rises and the last hour of light before sunset. That concept of a critical window of perfect sunlight was co-opted by emergency medical providers to refer to the crucial period of time immediately after an injury when appropriate life-saving medical or surgical intervention can offer the highest chance of survival for a traumatically injured patient.

In much of the world, road traffic accident victims and others suffering life-threatening injuries are not able to receive essential surgical care—including trauma, surgery, and anesthesia care—[within an hour](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries), or even many hours, following an accident. The window of opportunity for a chance at survival is narrow for a severely injured patient. Road traffic and other injuries kill more people every year than HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. Though injury-related deaths occur everywhere, the overwhelming majority happen in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where emergency communication systems and health care are often [limited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5907770/). Specialized and timely trauma care in LMICs is critical, though, to reducing permanent, long-term disability and deaths.

The study’s authors analyzed battlefield data for more than 21,000 military casualties during the U.S. involvement in the Afghanistan conflict. The data covered September 11, 2001 to March 31, 2014, comparing outcomes before and after the June 15, 2009 implementation of the golden hour mandate.

Before the golden hour mandate was implemented, the median time to transport a wounded service member was 90 minutes. After the mandate, the transport time dropped to 43 minutes. Cutting the average transport time in half also cut the fatality rate nearly in half, from 13.7 to 7.6 percent. Additionally, the final projected versus the actual case fatality rate equated to 359 lives saved.

"If a soldier survives the attack, after the first couple of minutes, as long as they're transported to a facility within that hour, their chances of survival are over 95 percent," Rone said.

The study points to three primary factors in these improved survival rates: better measures to control bleeding, more rapid blood-loss replacement and reducing the time from injury to reaching a field hospital (to 60 minutes or less, known as the ‘golden hour’).

In the case of the first, greater use of anticoagulant bandages, complemented by more rapid use of tourniquets, was of significant benefit. Traumatic amputation as the result of an improvised explosive device emphasised the importance of the fast application of tourniquets. Coping with and replacing blood loss was made easier by the extensive deployment of military paramedics, both with front-line troops down to platoon level and in land-based and helicopter ambulances.

McQueen’s command oversees the Army’s network of medical labs and R&D facilities scattered around the globe, from Africa to the top of Pikes Peak, Colorado. Speaking at a June 14 symposium of army medics, doctors, researchers, and commercial vendors, McQueen addressed five areas that his labs view as gaps military medicine would face in future large-scale combat operations: time, blood, oxygen, the Arctic, and disease.

Special operations medics [carried whole blood on battlefields](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-rangers-rolo-program/) for a significant portion of the Afghan and Iraq conflicts. Still, the permissions and logistics of getting it to regular units have been slow going.

  
Extended care also means oxygen, McQueen said, which requires two technologies: producing and storing it, and delivering it to critical patients in transient field hospitals, which the Army calls Role 2 facilities. 

“So if we’ve got currently two ventilators at a Role 2, do we need 20 at a future Role 2 to sustain that 72 to 96 hours in that space?” McQueen said. “If you’re going to get 20 more ventilators, you’re not going to get 20 more soldiers to run the ventilators, but how can we execute them with an AI capability?”

```
The Golden Hour is a standard used in emergency medicine and trauma care that states a person should receive definitive resuscitative and surgical care within one hour from injury. This is based on the belief that medical outcomes are improved if patients receive definitive care within the first sixty minutes after injury
```
```
In a paper by Unlu et al. the authors argued that “the urban legend of the ‘Golden 
Hour of shock’ does not quite apply to combat trauma” (Unlu et al. 2013, 84). They 
suggested that casualties may only have a critical five to fifteen minutes instead. This is, 
in fact, consistent with what Dr. Cowley actually argued when he made his Golden Hour 
statement. Immediately after making his Golden Hour claim, Dr. Cowley went on to state 
that the trauma patient may in fact have only a critical fifteen minutes (Lerner and 
Moscati 2001). 
```
```
MacLeod et al. investigated civilian trauma deaths that 
occurred within the first sixty minutes after injury to determine if they were all non-
survivable. The authors concluded that the overwhelming majority of patients with all 
causes of death were most likely to die in the first fifteen minutes of injury (MacLeod et 
al. 2007). 
```

```
Several others directly investigated if this held true for combat injuries and similar 
injuries in civilian settings. These studies concluded that there are at least two peaks of 
death. They are the time interval from five to fifteen minutes and the interval between 
sixty and one hundred eighty minutes (Champion et al. 2003; Clarke et al. 2002; 
Osterwalder 2002; Demetriades et al. 2005). In light of these studies Remik et al., during 
their review of trauma literature, made recommendations regarding medical evacuation 
for military medical systems. They acknowledged the lack of data for a Golden Hour 
time limit and suggested that increased quality of en route care can significantly extend 
the survival window for combat injured (Remick et al. 2010). 
```
```
The determination of potentially survivable was based on an artificial standard 
that the service member could immediately receive optimal care at a ROLE III facility. 
The study acknowledged that only one in three of these potentially survivable deaths 
actually could be cared for with current technology.
```

```
Of the potentially survivable deaths, 91 percent were due to hemorrhage and 8 
percent were due to problems with airway management. The number and percentage of 
potentially survivable deaths due to hemorrhage was likely inflated because the universal 
use of approved combat tourniquets was not standard until 2007 (Cordts, Brosch, and 
Holcomb 2008). Both of these causes of death must be addressed within the first few 
minutes. Brain death can result after as little as five minutes without adequate oxygen. 
```

```
Other studies support these findings that hemorrhage is the overwhelming cause 
of potentially survivable deaths. Kelly et al. determined that 83 percent to 87 percent of 
these deaths had hemorrhage and 10 percent to 15 percent of these deaths had inadequate 
airway management as contributing factors
