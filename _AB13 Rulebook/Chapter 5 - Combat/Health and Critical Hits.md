SELECTED Candidate 11: integrated into health system
Source: combination of Traveller and Spycraft rules
## Durability
Starts at FIT+MUS+RES points. Damage allocates first to durability until empty, then to trauma.
## Trauma
starts at 0, grows with all injuries beyond the character's durability capacity.

If the trauma score passes a character's trauma limit of 21 points (or 15+FIT), the character is totally incapacitated from major trauma.
	note: 21 is based on the rule of 3s

you gain trauma by ...
- taking damage in excess of durability
* failing to eat during the day
	- gain 1 trauma. Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient food.
- failing to drink during the day
	- gain 7 trauma. Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient water.
 - life threatening injury (d)
	- gain 1 trauma per degree(d) of the wound per turn.
if unconscious with a life threatening injury
	- gain 1 trauma per degree of the wound

You can voluntarily earn trauma...
- You can only spend trauma on your turn with a 5 tick action.
- You cannot spend trauma while unconscious.
- you may...
	- reduce fatigue by 2 (1 trauma)
	- add 5 durability (1 trauma).
		- Can only happen once per exchange of fire.

you can lose trauma by...
- a day of normal rest by 1 point
- a day of bedrest by amount equal to Healing Factor.
- eating and drinking normally reverses 1 batch of starvation and dehydration damage 
- eating, drinking in excess reduces trauma by 1, to a maximum of 2.

Some trauma is temporary
 - You can gain 7 trauma for every minute with zero oxygen. This is reversed at a rate of 7 trauma per 5 ticks of breathing air again.

## Criticals and Hit locations
### operating procedure for crits

1. Attackers achieve critical hits when their side dice succeeds on the TN.
	1. Severity is determined by the Attack's damage (plus the second die's margin?)
2. roll 3d6
	1. 2d6 selects the region
	2. 1d6 selects the class of anatomic structure. If a region does not contain that structure, the critical fails
3. GM decides the crit effect by fiat, using the severity, region and structure affected to decide through a [[deck of injuries]].
	2. most stats are based on the severity and the structure
4. Player writes the crit on their sheet, applies effect
### Severity

| Critical Severity |        |          |                                 |     |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- | --- |
| Code              | Margin | Injury   | Example                         |     |
| 0                 | 0      | Minor    | -                               |     |
| 1                 | 1      | Moderate | fractured sternum               |     |
| 2                 | 2      | Serious  | open fracture of humerus        |     |
| 3                 | 4      | Severe   | perforated trachea              |     |
| 4                 | 8      | Critical | ruptured liver with tissue loss |     |
| 5                 | 16     | Maximal  | total severance of aorta        |     |
### Alternative
Every 1 rolled for an attack counts as a critical.
	The lower number on a 2d20H doesn't count for the purpose of a critical.

### Todo
- [ ] create a generic and sample critical effects deck
## Trauma care

Major trauma requires critical care within a certain time period for a good prognosis, which can be extended by stabilization. Failure to apply critical care in this time period results in a poor prognosis.

**Good prognosis**: A character with a good prognosis eventually returns to the campaign.

**Poor prognosis**: A poor medical outcome means the character is permanently removed from play in the campaign, either through death or extreme disability.

## Stage III: Headshot!
- Damage is increased by 4 when making a head shot

---
# Fatigue
starts at 0 and grows. Soft stacks on top of trauma.

If the trauma and fatigue combined passes the trauma limit, the character has to take a will check or fall unconscious.
    They regain consciousness when their combined trauma/fatigue score is reduced.

For logistical purposes, Unconscious characters execute their turns at the following rates:
- 10 ticks in an exchange of fire
- once in a tactical pause
- once per minute out of combat.

fatigue is increased by...
- +1: staying awake longer than 12 Hours
	- per day
	- test against will
- +1: not sleeping after a day of hard work or travel
	-  per work period
- +1 per encounter: not sleeping after a day of combat
	- per encounter
- +x: fatigue damage in excess of durability from certain weapons
- x 2: adverse weather conditions
	- per condition

fatigue is reduced by...
- Standard rest. Reduces fatigue by half the trauma limit
- partial rest. Reduces fatigue by a quarter of the character's trauma limit
# Sustenance hazard
## Trauma
If using the sustenance hazard, you can gain trauma by ...
* failing to eat during the day
	- +1 trauma. 
	- Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient food.
- failing to drink during the day
	- +7 trauma. 
	- Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient water.
