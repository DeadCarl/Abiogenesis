SELECTED Candidate 11: integrated into health system
Source: combination of Traveller and Spycraft rules
## vitality
Starts at 0, grows to a maximum of FIT+MUS+RES. Damage allocates first to vitality until full, then to health condition.
## health condition
starts at 15+FIT (or 21 points), worsens with all injuries beyond the character's vitality.
	note: 21 is based on the rule of 3s
	
When a character's health condition reaches 0, they are instantly [[incapacitated]], suffer a critical hit and cannot further participate in the fight.

When a character's health goes into the negatives, their injury becomes a threat to life. If a character reaches the negative of their health condition score, they are dead.
## Fatigue

If a character's health plus their fatigue reaches below zero, they are [[incapacitated]]. They do not suffer a critical hit, nor do they require hospital care to return to the fight.

## Recovery

### Wounds
A character with less than full health only needs field care to recover. Hospital care can  speed up the healing process.
### Incapacitation
A patient with a critical injury or negative health requires hospital-level care to recover. This may be as little as complete bed rest and recuperation, which results in an incredibly slow process, incredibly fast with a complete intensive care unit with a full surgical staff, or a mixture inbetween.

However this goes, a character recovers health by the healing factor from their hospital care. For now, for now, the healing factor ranges between .1 to 1 times the protective factor of the building they are housed in.

## Criticals and Hit locations
### operating procedure for crits
1. Every dice that turns up 1 is a critical.
	1. The lower number on a 2d20H doesn't count for the purpose of a critical.
	2. Severity is determined by the Attack's damage
	3. criticals fail on a glancing blow
2. roll 3d6
	1. 2d6 selects the region
	2. 1d6 selects the class of anatomic structure. If a region does not contain that structure, the critical fails
3. GM decides the crit effect by fiat, using the severity, region and structure affected to decide through a [[deck of injuries]].
	2. most stats are based on the severity and the structure
4. Player writes the crit on their sheet, applies effect

# Fatigue
starts at 0 and grows. Soft stacks on top of health condition.

If the health condition and fatigue combined passes the health condition limit, the character has to take a will check or fall unconscious.
    They regain consciousness when their combined health condition/fatigue score is reduced.

For logistical purposes, Unconscious characters execute their turns at the following rates:
- 10 ticks in an exchange of fire
- once in a tactical pause
- once per minute out of combat.

fatigue is increased by...
- +1: staying awake longer than 12 Hours
	- per day
	- test against will
- +1: not sleeping after a day of hard work or travel
	-  per work period
- +1 per encounter: not sleeping after a day of combat
	- per encounter
- +x: fatigue damage in excess of vitality from certain weapons
- x 2: adverse weather conditions
	- per condition

fatigue is reduced by...
- Standard rest. Reduces fatigue by half the health condition limit
- partial rest. Reduces fatigue by a quarter of the character's health condition limit
# Sustenance hazard
## health condition
If using the sustenance hazard, your condition worsens by ...
* failing to eat during the day
	- +1 health condition. 
	- Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient food.
- failing to drink during the day
	- +7 health condition. 
	- Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient water.
