SELECTED Candidate 11: integrated into health system
Source: combination of Traveller and Spycraft rules
Added: Candidate 1 for trauma care
# The Short and Sweet
## vitality
Starts at 0, grows to a maximum of FIT+MUS+RES. Damage allocates first to vitality until full, then to health condition.
## health condition
For humans, health starts at 15+FIT (or 21 points), worsens with all injuries beyond the character's vitality.
	note: 21 is based on the rule of 3s
	
When a character's health condition reaches 0, they are instantly [[incapacitated]], suffer from either a critical hit or [instability] equal to the negative health score they were hit by, and cannot further participate in the fight. 

When a character's health goes into the negatives, their injury is life threatening and they require resuscitation. If a character reaches the negative of their health condition score, they are dead.

---
A character's condition worsens by ...
- taking damage in excess of vitality
* failing to eat during the day
	- lose 1 health. Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient food.
- failing to drink during the day
	- lose 7 health. Can only be reversed when receiving sufficient water.
	- Notes: Dryad suggested an increasing measure
 - life threatening injury (d)
	 - lose 1 health per degree(d) of the wound per turn.

You can voluntarily worsen your health condition...
- you may...
	- improve fatigue by 2 (1 health)
	- improve vitality by 5 (1 health).
		- Can only happen once per exchange of fire.
- You can only spend health condition on your turn with a 5 tick action.
- You cannot spend health to or while [[health condition care|incapacitated]].

~~you can improve health by...
- ~~1 point per day of normal rest
- ~~a day of bedrest by amount equal to Healing Factor.
- ~~eating and drinking normally reverses 1 batch of starvation and dehydration damage 
- ~~eating, drinking in excess reduces health condition by 1, to a maximum of 2.

Some health condition is temporary
 - You can lose 7 health for every minute with zero oxygen. This is reversed at a rate of 7 health condition per 5 ticks of breathing air again.

# The long and messy
## Fatigue
If a character's health plus their fatigue reaches below zero, they are [[incapacitated]]. They do not suffer a critical hit, nor do they require hospital care to return to the fight.
### Wounds
A character with more than 0 health only needs field care to recover. Hospital care can  speed up the healing process.
## Critical injuries
A patient with a critical injury requires hospital-level care to recover.
### operating procedure for crits
1. Every dice that turns up 1 is a critical.
	1. The lower number on a 2d20H doesn't count for the purpose of a critical.
	2. Severity is determined by the Attack's damage
	3. criticals fail on a glancing blow
2. roll 3d6
	1. 2d6 selects the region
	2. 1d6 selects the class of anatomic structure. If a region does not contain that structure, the critical fails
3. GM decides the crit effect by fiat, using the severity, region and structure affected to decide through a [[deck of injuries]].
	2. most stats are based on the severity and the structure
4. Player writes the crit on their sheet, applies effect
### Severity

|          | Critical Severity |        |          |                                 |     |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------- | --- |
| IRL Code | game Code         | Margin | Injury   | Example                         |     |
| 1        | 0                 | 0      | Minor    | -                               |     |
| 2        | 1                 | 1      | Moderate | fractured sternum               |     |
| 3        | 2                 | 2      | Serious  | open fracture of humerus        |     |

| 5        | 4                 | 8      | Critical | ruptured liver with tissue loss |     |
| 6        | 5                 | 16     | Maximal  | total severance of aorta        |     |
~~Severity is impacted by the availability of definitive care~~
### Alternative

## Incapacitation
A character that is incapacitated is unable to act due to pain, shock, or loss of consciousness.
## After Incapacitation: life threatening trauma
An incapacitated character in negative health is usually an unstable character, one who is in the process of experiencing the trauma triad: 

```
Severe [bleeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding "Bleeding") in trauma diminishes [oxygen delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_delivery "Oxygen delivery"), and may lead to [hypothermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia "Hypothermia"). This in turn can halt the [coagulation cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation "Coagulation"), preventing [blood from clotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy "Coagulopathy"). In the absence of blood-bound oxygen and nutrients ([hypoperfusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoperfusion "Hypoperfusion")) the body's cells burn glucose [anaerobically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation "Lactic acid fermentation") for energy, causing the release of [lactic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid "Lactic acid"), [ketone bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone_bodies "Ketone bodies"), and other [acidic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid "Acid") compounds into the blood stream, which lower the blood's [pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH "PH"), leading to [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis "Metabolic acidosis"). Such an increase in acidity damages the tissues and organs of the body and can reduce [myocardial performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_output "Cardiac output"), further reducing the oxygen delivery.[
```

In other words, they are bleeding out and losing the oxygen necessary to avoid brain damage.

For every operational tick (1 exchange of fire or 1 minute), a character rolls a fitness test - the current degree of instability. On success, the degree of instability decreases by 1, but on failure the character's health is reduced by the instability score.

If a character receives an additional piece of instability, either the current instability score is exchanged for the higher score, or it is increased by 1.
### Stage I
NPCs (or PCs who aren't story essential) can be handled in 2 ways by the GM's discretion:
1. their survival isn't relevant enough, so they are instantly removed from play
2. secondary characters who are relevant can roll a fitness check - the amount of negative health. If they fail this check, they are removed from play
### Stage II
A story relevant patient experiencing negative health requires hospital-level care to recover. This may be as little as complete bed rest and recuperation, an incredibly slow process, an incredibly fast recovery through an intensive care unit with a full surgical staff, or a mixture in-between.

However this goes, a character recovers health by the healing factor from their hospital care. For now, for now, the healing factor ranges between .1 to 1 times the Quality of life factor of the building they are housed in.
### Treating instability
Resuscitating a character is the preferred way to go. A Resuscitation is a supply dependent  operational task that uses first aid supplies to roll an emergency medicine skill - the degree of instability.

Success on the main die reduces instability by the margin of success -2 (minimum 1). On a primary failure, the patient's health is reduced by their current instability score, and on a secondary failure the technician uses up a unit of first aid.
