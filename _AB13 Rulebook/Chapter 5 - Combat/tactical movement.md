# Open actions

When a player declares his character is taking an open action, he can also simultaneously execute another tactical action with a tick cost less than or equal to than the open action's cost, with limitations specified by the open action.

Both actions are resolved simultaneously.
# posture
## Prone
## Crouched
# Tactical Movement
Movement during an exchange of fire is a special type of action known as an open action, costing 5 ticks.

Characters cannot change stance during movement.

Tactical movement is divided into two broad paces - normal speed and top speed - with their own properties and restrictions. Additionally, there are multiple special paces which further modify either speed.

Normal, top value

| Pace         | Value             | Modifiers |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Top Speed    | 10 meters + mus/2 | -3 to hit |
| Normal speed | Top speed/2       | -1 to hit |

## Sprinting
~~ver 1: Characters can sprint once per exchange of fire for free. Each additional sprint requires a fitness check. On failure, the character cannot sprint until the next operational pause.

ver 2: at the end of an exchange of fire, roll for fitness. On failure, the character gains fatigue.

If a character loses half of their trauma to fatigue or damage, they cannot sprint.

add: every turn spent sprinting increases fatigue by 1?

# Notes

Terrain effects load carriage: one compilation of studies has shown that for the same load weight, walking through swamp or on sand essentially doubles the energy cost of walking on a paved road, and walking in snow without snowshoes can increase this cost by 4 to 6 times.

The addition of an external load increases energy cost. The distribution of the heavier items within the load within a pack can affect the energy expenditure during load carriage, as well as the body mechanics of how the load is carried. Concentrating the heavier items higher in the pack and closer to the body can reduce energy cost of marching by as much as 25 percent as compared to a load that is placed low in the pack and away from the body (see figure C-2 on page C-4).

Increasing load weight can substantially increase Soldier energy expenditure during typical foot march conditions. When carrying loads less than or equal to 30 percent of Soldier’s bodyweight, energy expenditure remains constant; however, when Soldier’s load increases above 30 percent of bodyweight the rate of energy expenditure increases throughout the march.

### Considerations for turn mods

Animals of smaller mass turn better
Better leg strength improves turning

The speed rating acts as a fulcrum - moves below that rating gain a bonus and moves above it v

going at speeds higher than rated reduces turning skill
### Rules
base difficulty level for a 90 degree turn at trot speed. Failure means crashing.

A character may always make up to a 15 degree turn at any speed. at trotting speed, a character must pass an agility test to turn 90 degrees. If a character is sprinting, they must pass an agility test to make any turn greater than 15 degrees.

Margins: every degree of success or failure improves or worsens the character's turn angle by 15 degrees. Extraordinary failures may result in the character crashing or falling.

turns below trot speed are not tested.

Turning angles can be spent at any point of a move action.


```
MD90 = Move radius  90 degrees

we use the fraction of the distance covered to the MD90 to determine the effective angle the creature can turn

problem: as speed goes up, the turn circle reduces because of our traction budget is spent more and more on maintaining control instead of turning. In other words, we can oversteer under a certain point, and we can only understeer after a certain point
```

## Hitting moving targets
### Considerations
Core concerns of estimating aim difficulty of hitting moving target

Estimate the fire control package calability of a human to hit a moving target

Hitting a moving target entails leading the projectile point of aim in front of the target in time and space

The target is constrained to one track,  meaning only forward movement in a direction from the shooter matters

# Figures of thumb

5 ft/sec = 4 mph
1m/s = 3.6 kph
empirical minimum flying speed (not statistically determined)


For an approximation of kmh to ms, divide kmh by 4

For movement, ticks appear to be denominated in .5 second increments

to convert m/s to m/action, multiply m/s by the denomination, then multiply by 5

to convert m/a to m/s, divide by 5 and by the denomination

## Biology

For a human, the move speed is a brisk pace  of 3.5 mph, equivalent to a trot or march

# Speed, Vehicles
ai response

Speed can have a significant impact on the severity of collisions and the risk of injury or death:
### Force of impact
The force of impact increases exponentially with speed, which can lead to more extensive property damage, greater risk of injury, and higher probability of fatalities. For example, a crash at 30 mph has twice as much energy and destructive potential as a crash at 20 mph.
Risk of injury
The risk of injury increases exponentially with impact speed. For example, the average risk of severe injury for a pedestrian struck by a vehicle is 10% at 16 mph, 25% at 23 mph, 50% at 31 mph, 75% at 39 mph, and 90% at 46 mph.
Risk of death
The risk of death for a pedestrian increases rapidly above impact speeds of around 30 mph. For example, a pedestrian hit at 30 mph has a one in five chance of being killed, while this rises to a one in three chance if they are hit at 35 mph.
Braking distance
Higher driving speeds also mean longer braking distances, which can make it harder to avoid a collision. Braking distance is proportional to the square of the speed, so it increases considerably as speed increases. 

The greater the impact speed, the greater the chance of death. A pedestrian hit at 30mph has a very significant (one in five) chance of being killed. This rises significantly to a one in three chance if they are hit at 35mph. Even small increases in speed can lead to an increase in impact severity.

16
23
31
39
46

In simpler terms: for every 10 mph of increased speed, the risk of dying in a crash doubles.

16 kph x1 - 4 ms - 6 mt x 5 - 30 mm
32 kph x2 - 8 ms - 12 mt x 5 - 60 mm
48 kph x4 - 12 ms - 18 mt x 5 - 90 mm
64 kph x8 - 16 ms - 24 mt x 5 - 120 mm
80 kph x16 - 20 ms - 30 mt x 5 - 150 mm
96 kph x32 - 24 ms - 36 mt - 180 mm

Footnote - we can halve the damage multiplier for player safety and ease of calc. For hardcore mode, you can be less forgiving (damage as listed)

100 kph - 25 ms - 38 mt - 190 mm
