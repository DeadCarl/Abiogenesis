## Armor value
Modern armor is almost always a compromise of weight and protection. To derive an effective armor value for the entire package, average the armor value of every individual piece of protection and weigh each value by the amount of coverage.

For example, SAPI plates confer complete immunity to 5.56 rounds, which have 5 penetration, and therefore have AV15. However, SAPI plates never cover the entire torso, so the coverage weakens this effective armor value. If we are modelling a plate carrier which possesses all or nothing protection, we can then assume that the plate covers 50% of the vitals, and so the plate carrier has only AV8. The round damages the character on a 3+.
