Success  and  failure  aren’t  always  certain  in  a  roleplaying game.  The Reflex System’s task resolution system reflects this fact. When your character attempts an action that isn’t guaranteed to succeed or doomed to fail, you make a task check.  

When you make a task check, you roll one or more d20s, as determined by the nature of the check (see Attribute Checks and Skill Checks, following).  Every task check is rolled against a target number (TN).  If the die result is lower than or equal to the TN, your character succeeds at whatever he was attempting to do.  If the die result exceeds the TN, he fails.

In Reflex 2, we introduce a new concept known as an accessory metric: characters can now make a check which determines multiple characteristics about the outcome of their action, such as how fast did they act, how economical they were with resources, or how many units they made. Metrics are a qualitative modifier to a tasks outcome, ...

Accessory metrics come in two flavors - mandatory and voluntary. All metrics compete against the same TN

Mandatory metrics are those in which a task needs to determine multiple characteristics of the task at the same time - a character may not have just have to succeed, but do so quickly. Before resolving a task, a player has to decide the order of their metrics, assigning each a place from the lowest result up. If there are not enough dice to cover all metrics, the metrics not assigned to a die automatically receive the basic result.

For example, if a character must succeed at a task quickly and efficiently, they need 3 dice to attempt all three ~~and then decide the order of their metrics in any order~~. The character choses to emphasize speed over success and efficiency. If the TN is 8 and the character rolled a 2, 6, and 10, then they have barely succeeded in a quick manner, but were unable to be efficient in the process. If the second die had instead returned a 9, the character would have failed. If the character only had 2 dice in the pool, then the third metric automatically resolves to the worse result, such as the lowest result in a contested roll or the most basic output in a production roll.

Voluntary metrics are handled a little differently: If a character decides a little panache is in order, then they must bet at least 1 dice to every metric they wish to test into an independent pool. For example, if a character with a dice pool of 3 voluntarily decides to attempt for additional speed, they can set aside up to 2 dice for their speed metric and up to 2 dice for their success metric, but both need at least 1 dice.

Success and accuracy are considered primary metrics: if they fail, the task fails. All other metrics are secondary.
