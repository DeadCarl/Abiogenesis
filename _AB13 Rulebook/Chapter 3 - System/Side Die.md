In twilight 2013, characters usually roll multiple dice and discard all but the worst. These discarded dice are called side-dice.

# Candidate 1

These side dice can be used to bet on the success of the roll. The player must announce what effect they wish to improve, and how much dice they will set aside to improve it. This number of dice is then deducted from the test itself.

## Notes:
Currently, this is the simplest method to apply

# Candidate 2

# Derivative Dice


# Candidate 1

First order objectives and second order

Sometimes you have to prioritize goals or cannot put all your effort to a task.

Second order objectives tend to be the result of distracted driving, multitasking, or the result of inflexible organizations

In a second order result, you take the SECOND LOWEST number of your dice pools results.

Likewise for third and other ordered results

For lower than 2d20l results, it effectively makes the dice a level worse. 1d20 becomes 2d20h , 2d20h becomes 3d20h. Then again, you shouldn't be trying to do these tasks while sloshed...

# Candidate 2: Vectors

a vector has both a magnitude and a direction

This can be translated into the task attributes of power (magnitude) and precision (direction), since we usually care about how precisely we put the result on target

imprecision when measuring precision
	In the real world, most things aren't perfectly accurate, so we need to introduce a deviation that represents how off the force is

A vector test measures multiple variables at the same time. By default, most games measure 1 variable in a test, and use a turn the other variable into a static number

T13 Task vectors

Candidate B (candidate A was choose your dice) is that you get at least 2d20. the first die is your precision, which determines if you succeed.

the second die is your magnitude, which measures the value of power/speed/whatever you need to measure in that task, how well you succeed

skill levels otherwise work like t13 vanilla where you get spares



ORE magic

You roll X d10, where X is skill+stat+potentially modifiers from traits or the like
you have a 7x2 match, a 6x4 match , an a 10x2 match



# Candidate 3
When you roll a dice pool for a learned skill, you assign a dice to each action trait you want to focus on during a turn.

Only one action can be assigned to each die.

All nonspecified traits take the worst die of the set.
	ALT 1: All nonspecified traits are treated as having a roll of 15(20?])

the list of action traits include:
- "Accuracy" - Proficiency, or Success. Includes impact.
- Precision
- Defense/Cover
- Concealment
- Tactics
- Efficiency*?
- Productivity*?
- Agility*?
- Style
- 

Special action traits:
- Range

# Candidate 5: Value pool
A pool of d20s with a TN versus something.

Every d20 that passes the TN counts as additional value.

This can support things such as
- Critical damage
- loot
- looking for cover/concealment
- reliability #proposal

The margin the TN is passed by is known as the height. If a value pool is rolled for a set of objects, this determines the value of each individual thing found. If the value pool is only for a single object, add the number of successes together instead.
