Chapter 3
---

Welcome to the end of the world. 

These are the rules that enable you to  tell stories in the post-apocalyptic uncertainty of Twilight: 2013.

# The reflex system 

The rules that Twilight: 2013 uses are collectively called  the Reflex System. This system is designed for rapid, descriptive  play. While some aspects of the game are intricately detailed, our  intent is for most of the heavy math to take place during character creation and periodic maintenance, rather than bogging down action scenes. We’ve written these rules with the assumption that you have some prior experience with roleplaying games – at least enough to understand these basic concepts: 

• The concept of a roleplaying game as an attempt at cooperative narration, or at least as a series of problem- solving exercises; 
•The roles of game masters (GMs) and players; 
•The functions of player characters (PCs) and non-player characters (NPCs);
•The idea that the point of the game should be for everyone  involved to have fun.
 With that said, here’s a quick summary of the basic principles of RPGs that are unique to, or modified for, the Reflex System.

#  staged rules 
 Individual play groups often use “house rules” to tune their game systems to a specific preferred level of complexity and realism. To facilitate this, we’ve written the Reflex System with three stages of rules. This book is written with a default level of **Stage II** in mind. However, scattered throughout the text,  sidebars and optional rules sections will highlight ways to simplify or enhance the rules for **Stage** I or **Stage III** complexity. Future  supplements will also provide additional focused rule sets for  **Stage III** play.

##  Stage I  
Basic. Stage I rules are the minimum necessary to numerically define a character and play a fast-running game. Stage I rules tend to boil fairly complicated events down to simple abstractions. This  level of complexity is recommended for introducing novice players to the Reflex System and the world of Twilight: 2013.
##  Stage II
 Standard. Stage II rules contain a default level of complexity that strikes a balance between speed of play and realism. The complete Stage II rules set incorporates all of the systems that we consider essential for capturing the realities of survival in a post- apocalyptic environment. 
##  Stage III
 Advanced. Stage III rules are written with the hardcore  wargamer in mind.  Stage III rules provide extra, often gritty,  details of various aspects of play. However, Stage III play does  tend to require a greater amount of bookkeeping and number- crunching.

# Dice

The Reflex System uses three sizes of dice: six-sided, ten- sided, and twenty-sided.The respective shorthand for these is “d6,” “d10,” and “d20.”Many rolls will require you to use multiple dice of the same size and total the results.The notation for these rolls follows the industry standard of putting the number of dice before the die size. For example, “3d6” means “roll three six-sided dice and add each die’s result together for the roll’s total.”

When you roll a die, the number that comes up on that die is the die result.

 If a roll requires the addition or subtraction of a fixed number, the text gives that number immediately after the notation for the dice.
For example, “3d6+3” means “roll three d6s, add the results of all the dice together, and add another 3 to the total.”

It’s also possible to use two d10s to generate random numbers ranging from 1 to 100.
This roll uses one d10 for the tens digit and the other d10 for the ones digit and is called a percentile roll.
For ease of use, we recommend rolling d10s of two different colors for percentile rolls, with one designated as the tens digit before the dice hit the table.

 Finally, some rolls – typically those involving task resolution – call for you to roll multiple dice of one size and use only the lowest or highest die result.
These rolls are noted with an “L” or an “H,” respectively, after the die size.
 
 Example: “3d20L” means “roll three d20s and use only the lowest of the three results.
”If such a roll results in the dice coming up 4, 13, and 18, the die result for this roll is that of the lowest die: 4.
# time
 Events in roleplaying games almost never occur at the same speed that they would in real life.
A month-long sea journey is best glossed over with a few moments’ description, while a gunfight lasting no more than a minute from the participants’ perspectives takes an hour or more to play out.
Accordingly, the Reflex System uses the following array of conventions to describe timekeeping from both the players’ and the characters’ perspectives.
##  Player Time 
Session: 
A session is a single sitting’s worth of game play.  Most GMs run sessions between three and six hours in length.In general, a single session’s play covers enough in-game events to make up a single one-hour episode of a television show. Depending on the pace of events, this could be no more than a few hours of character time (a couple of conversations with NPCs followed by a gunfight), or it could cover a month or more (an extended journey with few detailed events but several sessions of training with various communities).

 Operation: 
 An operation is a series of events that forms a complete story, from the initial scenes that set the stage through the final challenges that the characters face.An operation might last no more than a single session, but is more likely to last several sessions.In general, the events of an operation are roughly equivalent to the events of acomplete season of a television show. As with a session, an operation can cover a few days, a few weeks, or a year or more, depending on the pace of events.

 Campaign: 
 A campaign is a group’s ongoing play experiences, lasting as long as the players and GM focus on the continuing stories of the same group of players. A campaign lasts as long as the group keeps it going. We’ve heard of campaigns that have run for a decade, but don’t feel compelled to meet this record! 

Downtime: 
Downtime is “off-screen” time for the characters. Continuing the television analogy from above, it’s when characters repair or acquire new equipment, recover from injuries, work on ongoing projects, and reflect on lessons learned before plunging back into the action.The viewers don’t see these events happen; there’s little in the way of action or plot development to occupy the audience’s attention. When the next episode begins, though, things are different, and the characters are ready for more abuse at the hands of fate. We recommend that characters receive between one week and three months of downtime between operations. A single contiguous amount of downtime is referred to as a stretch of downtime in rules that reference it.

## Character Time
 Day: The basic unit of time for measuring character progress toward major goals (travel, long-term projects, healing) is a game day. When no large amount of intensiveactivity is occurring,players  and GMs can safely assume that characters are working hard, but not pushing themselves unduly: eight hours of sleep, eight to ten hours of work, and the remainder of each day being consumed by personal maintenance and perhaps a little recreation.
 
Scene: A scene in the Reflex System is akin to a scene in a television show: it occurs within one specific location and focuses on a single event or series of events that are worthy of more attention than an offhand description. A scene lasts as long as is required for the GM and players to resolve its events, but typically between a few minutes and an hour.

# Combat Time 
Time in combat requires special attention on the part of the GM and players, even though the precise length of time a firefight requires is usually of minimal interest to the characters caught in it. Many real-world combat veterans report extreme distortion of their perception of time during fights. The Reflex System models this perceptual dissonance via a somewhat abstract method of demarcating time in combat. Combat time is described in more detail in Chapter Five.

 Combat Scene:A combat scene is any scene in which combat occurs, and encompasses the events immediately preceding and following the combat as well as the fight itself. At minimum, it includes all exchanges of fire and pauses (see below) in a single combat. 

 Tick: A tick, like a tick of a clock, is just long enough for a character to perform a single action: shout a warning, squeeze a trigger, or take a furtive glance around the battlefield. Objectively, a tick lasts between a tenth of a second and half a second, but this distinction isn’t always important or evident to a character who’s in the thick of a firefight.

 Exchange of Fire: An exchange of fire is a rapid sequence of events in combat, lasting for enough ticks for the fastest character involved in the combat to do everything his initiative roll gives him time him to do (obviously, in the same amount of time, everyone else in the fight also has time to do everything his slower initiative roll lets him do).

Pause: A pause in the action, or pause for short, is a brief lull in combat while all involved parties reload, shout orders, pray, tend to their wounded, sneak up on enemies, or cower in foxholes – in short, do anything except continue to trade attacks. A pause occurs after the end of an exchange of fire in which all participants decide to stop attacking for a moment. It lasts for a variable amount of objective time, typically less than a minute. 

#  units of measurement 
The Reflex System uses metric measurements for distance, area, volume, and weight. For players who are more familiar with  U.S. customary units, the following equivalencies may be helpful: Distance Metric Unit 

## Range  
When discussing distances, range is a special case. The difference between visual or ballistic ranges of 5 meters and 10 meters is much more significant than the distance between visual or ballistic ranges of 705 meters and 710 meters. Accordingly, when ranges and related concepts such as ranged attacks come into play, the Reflex System eschews precise distance measurements in favor of broadlydescriptive range bands.

 The easiest way to envision range bands is as a set of concentric circles with the character at the center. Each range band has an inner and outer boundary. If the distance from the character to a target falls between those two boundaries, the target is within that band. The range bands, from closest to farthest, are:

 • Personal: Personal range is within arm’s reach of a character, or close enough to physically strike with a hand weapon.  Characters must be within personal range of one another to engage in physical contact, whether consensual (e.g. first aid) or hostile (e.g. a knife fight). 
 
• Gunfighting: Gunfighting range is from just outside arm’s  reach to 7 meters. According to law enforcement statistics, this is the range within which the vast majority of modern handgun combat occurs.

 • Close Quarters Battle (CQB): CQB range begins at 7 meters and extends to 25 meters, which makes it the maximum range at which most combat within buildings or large vehicles will occur.
 
 • Tight: Tight range is from 25 to 100 meters, the range at which most gunfights occur within cities, jungles, and other outdoor areas that tightly restrict movement and lines of sight. In the Tight range band and under normal field conditions the human eye will pick a human-sized target out of its surroundings more than 90% of the time.
 
 • Medium: The range that most military-scale combats will occur in surroundings with a moderate degree of cover and terrain complications. The Medium range band extends from 100 to 200 meters. This is the practical limit at which the unaided eye can discern significant details of a subject. Under normal field conditions, an average observer will discern a standing human target about 50% of the time at Medium range.

 •Open: As the name implies,the Open range band encompasses  the ranges at which most infantry actions take place in open terrain with minimal contours: 200 to 400 meters. Visual observation  normally encounters minimal penalties at these distances. Under normal field conditions, an average observer will discern a standing human target about 15% of the time at Open range.

 • Sniping: The range band from 400 to 800 meters is the province of long-range weapons. Visual observation can be significantly impaired at these distances. Under normal field conditions, the unaided human eye has less than a 5% chance of detecting standing human targets at Sniping range. Ranged attacks without magnifying optics are effectively impossible.

 • Extreme:From 800 to 1,600 meters, only the longest-ranged firearms have a chance of hitting man-sized objects. Unaided visual observation is limited to simple shapes and major details, and the naked eye cannot effectively discern a human target.

#  values and ratings 
The Reflex System uses both values and ratings to define various traits. A value is always numeric (e.g. 8), while a rating is always descriptive (e.g. Expert). If a trait has both a value and a rating, the value usually determines the rating.

 Some effects can cause a value or a rating to increase or decrease. Values are numeric, so their increases and decreases are purely arithmetic. Ratings are descriptive and most rated traits are presented on a scale. When an effect increases or decreases a rating, the effective rating is moved up or down the scale from the actual rating, as appropriate.

 Example: Skills are rated from worst to best as follows: Unskilled, Novice, Competent, Professional, Expert, Master, Legendary. If Erin normally has an Expert rating in a skill and an effect re- duces her rating by two levels, her new rating is Competent.

#  task resolution

 Success and failure aren’t always certain in a roleplaying  game. The Reflex System’s task resolution system reflects this fact.  When your character attempts an action that isn’t guaranteed to succeed or doomed to fail, you make a task check.

 When you make a task check, you roll one or more d20s, as determined by the nature of the check (see Attribute Checks and Skill Checks, following). Every task check is rolled against a target number (TN). If the die result is lower than or equal to the TN, your character succeeds at whatever he was attempting to do.  If the die result exceeds the TN, he fails.

## degrees of difficulty 

All challenges are not created equal. The value of your character’s relevant attribute determines the TN for a task of average difficulty, but many tasks will be easieror harder than average.
For such cases, the rules (or the GM’s discretion) may dictate a difficulty modifier.
This is a number that is added to or subtracted from the TN, depending on the task’s relative difficulty:

Difficulty Table 3b: Difficulty Modifiers

## bonuses and penalties
The difficulty modifier is the most common means by which a target number can change, but many task checks will be subject to TN modifications from other sources.
Both numerical bonuses and penalties can apply to a task’s TN.
A character can receive both multiple bonuses and multiple penalties to a single task.
Bonuses are always expressed as positive numbers (e.g. +3), while penalties are always expressed as negative numbers (e.g. –2).

Some circumstances may increase or reduce a bonus or penalty.
Both of these terms always refer to the magnitude of the modifier (or, in mathematical terms, its absolute value).
For example, if a bonus is +2 and an effect increases it by 1, it becomes a +3 bonus.
Conversely, if a penalty is –2 and an effect increases it by 1, it becomes a –3 penalty.

Neither a bonus nor a penalty can be decreased past zero.
A penalty of –2 that is decreased by 5 becomes a penalty of zero, not a bonus of +3.

No single bonus may ever be greater than +5.
No such restriction exists on penalties.
 
 Example 1: Justin has a base TN of 8 for a task. Two different sources provide bonuses: one grants a +3 and the other grants a +1.  Justin is also subject to a –2 penalty from another effect.  8 + 3 + 1 – 2 = 10, so Justin’s final TN is 10. 
 
  Example 2: Keith has a base TN of 6 for a task. Four dif- ferent sources provide bonuses: one grants a +7, another grants a +3, and the remaining two each grant +2. The +7 bonus decreases to +5 (the maximum possible for any sin- gle bonus). 6 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 18, so Keith’s final TN is 18.
  
 If cumulative bonuses and penalties decrease a task’s TN to zero or less, the task automatically fails.

On the other hand, a task with a TN of 20 or higher automatically succeeds.
##  margins 
In many cases, the margin by which a task check succeeds or fails is relevant to the magnitude or net effect of the success or failure.
A check’s margin is equal to the difference between the TN and the die result.
If the check succeeded, this is the margin of success (MoS); otherwise, it’s the margin of failure (MoF).
If the die result exactly equals the TN, then the check is still a success, but the margin of success is zero.

 In general, a margin of success of 5 or greater indicates complete and obvious success.
Conversely, a margin of failure greater than 5 usually means dismal and unsalvageable failure.
 Specific cases may supersede these broad guidelines.
 
 Example 1: Keith attempts an attack with a TN of 7.
His die result is a 3, so he succeeds with a margin of success of 4.
In all attacks, the margin of success is added to the weapon’s base Damage value to determine the final amount of damage inflicted.
Keith is attacking with a handgun with Damage 3, so his final damage total is 3 + 4, or 7.

 Example 2: Pete attempts to seduce the commander of the local military police garrison.
This task has a TN of 5.
The GM warns Pete that a margin of failure greater than 5 will result in him not just failing to seduce his target, but actively alienating her.
Pete rolls a 12.
With a margin of failure of 7, not only does he make a poor impression, but he’ll be the laughingstock of the entire MP force once the story circulates, and all future social interaction with the commander will suffer a penalty determined by the GM’s cruel whim.
 
##  Exceptional Success 
 Many checks require a “lowest of” roll of more than one die.
 In such a case, whenever multiple dice are lower than or equal to the target number, the check’s margin of success is determined using the lowest die.
The margin of success is then increased by 2 for each additional die that, taken on its own, would be a success.
 This models the fact that individuals with greater skills tend to consistently display qualitatively superior performance.

 Example: Keith attempts an attack with a TN of 7 and rolls 4d20L.
 His dice come up 3, 4, 10, and 15.
His die result is a 3, so he suc- ceeds with a margin of success of 4.
One additional die – the one that came up 4 – would be a success if considered on its own.
 Therefore, Keith’s margin of success is increased by 2, to 6.

## Attribute checks 
You make an attribute check whenever your character attempts an action that directly relies on an innate human quality, rather than leveraging a set of learned or trained capabilities.
 Specific circumstances call for checks with each attribute, as detailed in the attribute descriptions (see p.
 77).

Every attribute check is a 2d20L roll.
The base TN of each attribute check is the attribute’s value.

Example: Erin has Coordination 8, making her significantly above-average in terms of her innate mastery of spatial relation- ships and related factors.
When she attempts a Coordination check of normal difficulty, she rolls 2d20 against a TN of 8.

## skill checks 
You make a skill check whenever your character attempts an action that falls within the purview of that skill.
Specific circumstances call for checks with each skill, as outlined in the skill descriptions (see p. 80).
 
 A skill check involves rolls of a variable number of d20s, depending on your character’s rating in that skill.
Each task is associated with a single relevant attribute.
The base TN of the task check is equal to that attribute’s value.

Skill checks are subject to limits on the number of bonuses that your character can receive.
His degree of expertise limits how well he can apply the advantages that are at his disposal.
No task check may benefit from bonuses from a number of sources greater than the number of dice being rolled.
Unfortunately, no such restriction applies to penalties.

 Example: An attack with a handgun is a task that relies on the Sidearm skill and the Coordination attribute.
In addition to her aforementioned Coordination 8, Erin has a Professional rating in the Sidearm skill.
A skill check with a Professional-rated skill is a 3d20L roll.
Therefore, whenever Erin makes an attack with a handgun at normal difficulty, she rolls 3d20L against a TN of 8.
Each such skill check may receive bonuses from up to three different sources.

 In the current situation, four different factors give Erin bonuses.
 These bonuses are, respectively, +4, +2, +1, and +1 again.
Be- cause she can only benefit from three different bonus sources, her TN is increased to (8 + 4 + 2 + 1 =) 15.
The last +1 bonus is dropped with no effect.

## action types 
Simply sitting around and talking doesn’t make for a very exciting game experience.
 Over the course of play, characters will attempt to accomplish various goals.
Each such attempt is one action.

 All actions don’t require the same amount of time or effort.
 Pulling a trigger takes a fraction of a second; repairing a broken engine can consume hours; planting, raising, and harvesting a food crop is a months-long endeavor.
Some actions have only one component thought or motion, while others require the completion of multiple stages for overall success.
Accordingly, the Reflex System establishes several different types of actions.
### Simple Actions 
A simple action has only one step, and, mechanically speaking, requires only one task check to determine success or failure.
“Simple” in this case doesn’t necessarily mean “easy;” some simple actions are very difficult.
Examples of simple actions include throwing a football, taking an evasive maneuver with a helicopter, firing a gun, delivering a masterful saxophone solo, and recalling a fact from memory.
Unless otherwise indicated, any action described in this book is a simple action.
### Incremental Actions
An incremental action involves repeated discrete efforts toward a single goal over an extended period of time.
Unless otherwise specified, a character can walk away from a partially- completed incremental action and come back to resume his work later.
Each incremental action has a period, which is the amount of time required for one task check toward the action’s overall success.
In addition, it has a target total, which is the total number of successful task checks required for the overall incremental action to be successful.
A task check with a margin of success greater than 5 represents exceptional progress and counts as two successful checks toward this total.

 Progresstowardcompletinganincrementalactionismeasured by how many successful task checks have occurred.
Examples of incremental actions include conducting psychotherapy, repairing a truck’s engine, and researching an historical event.
 
 Example: The team decides to take over an abandoned police sta- tion as its base of operations.
Justin is tasked with getting the facility’s emergency generator back in operation.
This is an in- cremental action requiring Electronics skill checks with a period of 1 day and a target total of 5.
Justin breaks out his tools and starts working.
Over his first three days of work, he makes three task checks and succeeds at all three.
 
 On the next day, a fire breaks out at a nearby farm, and the team has to drop what it’s doing and assist with the emergency.
Justin suffers injuries in the process, which degrades his performance.
 His next two task attempts are dismal failures, and neither one counts as additional progress toward the target total.
He decides to wait a week and heal up before continuing the task, leaving it at three-fifths completion (three out of five required successes).
## Complications
Various circumstances can modify both simple and incremental actions.
###  Opposed Actions
An opposed action is one with an intended effect that is directly countered by another character’s action.
In most cases, this occurs when one character (the “attacker”) attempts to do something that another character (the “defender”) is actively trying to prevent.
When an opposed action occurs, both parties make their rolls and compare their results.
If the attacker succeeds and the defender fails, the attempt succeeds.
If the attacker fails, then the attempt fails regardless of the defender’s success or failure.

 If both parties succeed, the defender’s margin of success is subtracted from the attacker’s margin of success.
If the result is still zero or positive, it becomes the action’s final margin of success.
 However, if the result is negative, it instead becomes the action’s margin of failure.
 
 Both simple and incremental actions can be opposed.
In the case of an opposed incremental action, the act of opposing the action requires an amount of time equal to the action’s period.
 
 Example 1: Pete attempts to bluff his way past a moderately alert border guard.
This is a simple action — Pete’s telling an uncom- plicated story, and he has time for only a single attempt to fast- talk the guard before his pursuers arrive.
The GM decides that Pete must make a Personality-based Persuasion skill check, op- posed by the guard’s Personality attribute check.
Pete’s margin of success is 11, compared to the guard’s margin of success of 3.
Pete succeeds with a final margin of success of 8.
 
 Example 2: The team is engaged in a vicious basketball game.
 Matt attempts to block Andy’s jump shot.
Both players make Muscle checks.
Andy succeeds with a margin of success of 2, but Matt also succeeds with a margin of success of 5.
Matt’s long arms turn Andy’s success into a failure.

## Competing Actions 
A competing action is similar to an opposed action, but involves two or more parties striving to be the first or best to achieve the same result.
 
 In a competing simple action, all involved parties make the same task check.
The competitor with the greatest margin of success wins.

 In a competing incremental action, all involved parties make the same task check.
The competitor who reaches the target total first wins.
If two or more competitors simultaneously reach the target total, the winner is the one with the greatest margin of success on the last task check.
## Supply-Dependent Actions
A supply-dependent action is, as the name suggests, dependent not only upon a successful task check, but upon the expenditure of consumable supplies for its ultimate success.
Such an action has a base supply requirement, which is the total amount of supplies that are used up in the process of performing the action.
 These supplies are used regardless of whether the action succeeds or fails.
If your character can’t meet the supply requirement, the action has no chance of success .

If you don’t want to use the base supply requirement (or don’t have enough whole blood, fuel pumps, or lumber to meet it), you can attempt to stretch your available supplies by cutting corners.
This involves a voluntary reduction of the check’s supply requirement.
For every unit of consumables by which you reduce the supply requirement, the check suffers a cumulative –2 penalty.
 No other effect can reduce or eliminate this penalty.

 Both simple and incremental actions can all be supply- dependent.
In the case of an incremental action, each task check is treated as a separate attempt for the purposes of supply consumption.
## Led Actions
A led action occurs when one character (who hopefully has a high rating in the relevant skill) attempts to lead one or more less-skilled comrades through a task.
If you want to lead a task, you must declare your intent before making your initial skill check.
 Make your check with the normal relevant attribute as your TN.
 However, if your Command skill rating is lower than your rating in the relevant skill, make the check with your Command skill rating.

 If you succeed, you may voluntarily reduce your margin of success by any amount, to a minimum MoS of zero.
For each point of MoS reduction, you may designate one other character whose skill rating in the relevant skill becomes one level higher.
This bonus applies only for the purpose of performing the same task check you just performed.
No single character may receive more than one extra level of skill rating for any one task.
 
 Example: The team attempts to sneak across a well-guarded bor- der.
As the stealthiest team member, Matt attempts to lead Pete and Keith through the motions of unobserved movement.
Nor- mally, stealth in a wilderness environment is a Fieldcraft (AWA) check.
Matt has an Expert rating in Fieldcraft, but only a Com- petent rating in Command.
Accordingly, he makes a Command (AWA) check.
 He succeeds with a margin of success of 5.
 
 Keith has a Novice rating in Fieldcraft, while Pete is completely unskilled.
Matt reduces his own margin of success from 5 to 3 to boost each teammate’s Fieldcraft rating by one level.
Keith and Pete now make their own Fieldcraft (AWA) checks, respectively using Competent and Novice skill ratings.
# common modifiers 
Although many actions will involve modifiers specific to the task at hand, some basic modifiers are applicable to a wide range of tasks.
The following conditions – and the bonuses and penalties they impose – form the basis of the Reflex System’s standards for modifiers.
## Time 
A task’s description usually includes the amount of time that it takes a character to perform it.
This is a standard rather than a hard-and-fast rule.
Characters may pace themselves in order to measure twice and cut once, or they may risk shoddy work in the interest of expediency.
Taking more or less time than the standard applies the following modifiers: Time Adjustment

 Note: The modifiers given here do not apply to actions performed in combat.
Tactical and operational actions always take the same amount of time, as detailed in Chapter Five.
 
# Equipment 
Man is a tool-using animal.
The default difficulty of any action assumes that a character has at least basic equipment suited to the task at hand.
Characters with access to more precise, capable, or powerful tools receive bonuses, while those making do with inadequate resources suffer penalties.
The following table illustrates this with examples of equipment appropriate to two tasks that are regrettably common in Twilight: 2013: providing first aid for a serious injury and repairing a truck engine.

 In many cases, facilities require electrical power, compressed air, or other modern services for all equipment to function.
A facility without such resources provides only half its normal bonus.
# Assistance 
It’s hard to find good help after the end of the world.
 Surgical nurses are in short supply to assist the few surviving trauma surgeons, and not many network engineers can call on interns to run cable and test circuits.
Default difficulties and times assume that a character is attempting a task alone.
Extra hands and brains can provide significant benefits.
When determining bonuses for assistance, all assistants collectively count as one source.
 However, a task check may benefit from a maximum number of assistants equal to the number of dice rolled for the check.
# Skilled Assistance
For tasks that demand technical proficiency or advanced education, helpers must be trained in the same skill that is being used for the task check.
 The bonus each helper provides depends on his level of skill relative to that of the character performing (or leading) the task:
 
  Relative Skill Rating
  
   In addition, the base time for the task is divided by half the total number of characters undertaking it.

 Example: Candace (Expert rating in Medicine) attempts to re- move a bullet from Justin’s chest.
Candace will be rolling 4d20L for this surgical procedure, so she can benefit from up to four helpers.
Four helpers are available: Pete (Professional), Erin (Competent), Simon (Novice), and Matt (Unskilled).
 
 Pete’s rating is one level below Candace’s, so he would provide a +2 bonus.
Simon’s is two levels lower, so he would provide a +1 bonus.
Erin’s skill is three levels lower, so she would provide no bonus to the check, but her presence might still help to reduce the total time required for the task.
Matt’s Unskilled rating makes him an unlikely assistant, but if Candace thinks she can success- fully perform the procedure with him in the way, she might ac- cept the penalty for his “help” and let him assist as a learning experience (see p.
 198 for rules on learning experiences and how they allow characters to improve skills).
## Strong Backs and Weak Minds 
For tasks that just require extra hands to lift and carry, helpers must simply be in sufficient physical condition to accomplish the labor.
For light labor (e.g. basketweaving, foraging), this means no physical attribute lower than 3 and no wounds or illness greater than Moderate.
For heavy labor (e.g. building fortifications, harvesting crops), this means no physical attribute lower than 5 and no wounds or illness greater than Slight.
Whether a given task is light or heavy labor is left to the GM’s discretion, but the suggested rule of thumb is that any task that would cause an average adult to raise a sweat or feel sore afterwards is heavy labor.
In either case, each helper provides a cumulative +1 bonus.
# Visual Range 
Visual observation and ranged combat are limited by the capabilities of the human eye.
The greater the distance between an object and observer, the harder it is for the observer to notice, identify, examine, or attack it.
The Reflex System models the effects of distance by imposing a visual range penalty on all vision- dependent actions (including ranged attacks) that involve a subject located beyond Gunfighting range.
This penalty begins as a -1 in the CQB range band and doubles with each successive band: Range Band

These penalties assume normal daytime lighting and clear air.
Adverse lighting and atmospheric conditions can further penalize visual observation by increasing the effective visual range to a target.
For example, if an effect increases the effective visual range by two range bands, then an observer looking at an object in the Medium range band suffers penalties as if the target was in the Sniping range band.
Conversely, vision-enhancing equipment can reduce the apparent range to an object, decreasing penalties (see  p. 237 and p. 258).
## Target Size
Various studies have shown that it’s virtually impossible for the unaided human eye to pick out a man-sized target at ranges beyond 400 meters.
However, larger objects are visible (though not necessarily in great detail) as much longer ranges, while smaller objects may be imperceptible until they come much closer.
 Accordingly, a target that’s much larger or smaller than a normal human is considered to be closer or farther, respectively, for the purposes of visual range see the following table:
 
  Human Size Equivalence Table 3g: Size Modifiers 
  
## Environmental Conditions 
## Illumination
Characters require proper light levels for any task dependent on vision.
When the ambient light in a situation is too low or too intense, all such tasks suffer penalties, as described in the following lighting conditions.
From brightest to darkest, lighting conditions are as follows:
• Blinding: Too much light can be as bad as not enough light.
Blinding light is sufficiently intense to cause pain, and can lead to eye injury if viewed for more than a few minutes (GM’s discretion).
Examples include direct views of the sun, full sunlight reflected on snow, a welding torch, and the ubiquitous nuclear fireball.
Lesser light sources such as parachute flares or smaller explosions are also considered blinding if a character’s eyes are adapted to darker-than-adequate lighting conditions from at least three minutes of exposure.
Blinding light increases effective visual range by two range bands.
At the GM’s discretion, it also inflicts a –4 penalty on other task checks.

 • Excessive: Excessive light is present when the level of illumination causes viewers to squint or shield their eyes in order to see clearly.
Examples include the sun viewed through heavy cloud cover or precipitation, partial sunlight reflected on snow, and flashlights or headlights shining directly into the viewer’s eyes.
 Excessive light increases effective visual range by one range band.
 At the GM’s discretion, it also inflicts a –2 penalty on other task checks.

 • Adequate: The default lighting condition is illumination ranging from sunlight on a clear summer day to indoor residential lighting from conventional electric bulbs.
Adequate light inflicts no penalties.
 
 • Dim: Dim illumination provides enough light for a character to navigate unimpeded and perform most common tasks, but fine visual discernment is difficult.
Examples of dim lighting conditions include dawn or twilight, an indoor area with emergency or maintenance lights, a scene lit only by sporadic fires, a movie theatre in the middle of a film, and a clear night with a full moon and no overhead cover.
Dim light increases effective visual range by one range band.
At the GM’s discretion, it also inflicts a –2 penalty on other task checks.

 • Minimal: In minimal illumination, the human eye is incapable of discerning most colors, and only vague outlines of shapes are immediately visible.
Examples of minimal illumination include a cloudy night, the light from a single candle in a large room, and an airliner cabin with only the emergency lights on the floor.
 Minimal light increases effective visual range by two range bands.
 At the GM’s discretion, it also inflicts a –4 penalty on other task checks.

 • None: Complete darkness – any enclosed space with no illumination – inflicts automatic failure on any task check reliant on vision.
If a character can accomplish a task solely by touch (GM’s discretion), any related task check still suffers a –5 penalty.
 and the task takes three times as long as normal if it isn’t an instant action.
These penalties may be mitigated or eliminated (again at the GM’s discretion) if the character has previously trained to perform that specific task without visual guidance.
We strongly recommend that the GM disallow any sudden revelations that the character “knew how to do it all along” — such training should be previously established through character history or roleplaying.
 
 • Chaotic: Chaotic illumination occurs when lighting conditions are rapidly shifting between dark and normal to bright, which can be disorienting for those unaccustomed to it.
This typically occurs in situations where light sources are constantly strobing: a firefight, or a crime scene lit by the flashing light bars of emergency vehicles.
Chaotic lighting increases effective visual range by one range band in addition to any penalties imposed by dim or minimal lighting.
A character with a Coolness Under Fire of 6 or greater ignores this effect.
## Atmospheric Conditions
The human eye evolved to work in clear air.
Substances falling through it or floating in it can significantly reduce visual acuity.
 
 • Precipitation: Mist, light drizzle, or snow flurries increase effective visual range by one range band.
Steady rain or snowfall increase it by two range bands.
A heavy downpour or blizzard increases it by three range bands.
 
 • Fog: Morning haze increases effective visual range by one range band.
 Light or patchy fog increase it by two range bands.
 Dense fog increases it by four range bands.
 
 • Sand/Dust/Smoke: Airborne particulate matter isn’t technically precipitation, but it imposes penalties in a similar manner.
Light particulates (i. e.
 occasional windblown swirls, campfire smoke) increase effective visual range by one range band.
Steady particulates (i.
e.
 strong windblown sheets, structure or forest fire smoke) increase it by two range bands.
Dense particulates (i.
e.
 dust storms, burning tires, smoke grenades or generators) increase it by three range bands.
## Wind 
Strong winds affect all airborne objects, both projectiles and vehicles.
Exceptionally high wind speeds can also affect the ability of personnel and ground vehicles to move safely.
From lightest to strongest, wind conditions are as follows.

• Mild: Calm air and mild wind (up to 39 km/hr or Beaufort 0-5) have no game effect.
 
 • Moderate: Moderate wind (40-62 km/hr or Beaufort 6-7) is enough to raise large waves and whips their crests into foam, make trees move, turn umbrellas inside-out, make wires and cables whistle, and raise clouds of blowing sand or dust.
Ranged attacks suffer a –1 penalty at distances past optimum range, as do skill checks involving fine manipulation.
Control checks with ground vehicles suffer a –1 penalty, while those with aircraft and watercraft suffer a –2.

• Strong: Strong wind (63-87 km/hr or Beaufort 8-9) can raise 3-meter waves, break small branches from trees, strip exterior fixtures from buildings, and impede personal movement.
 All penalties from moderate wind are increased by 1.
In addition, a character standing upright moves as if he had a slight leg injury.
 
 • Major Storm: Winds severe enough to be classified as storm force (over 88 km/hr or Beaufort 10+) inflict increased or additional penalties at the GM’s discretion.
Such weather events are likely to be major plot points in and of themselves, inflicting devastation over a wide area.
## Temperature Extremes
Humans – and, in most cases, the equipment they design – operate best at temperatures between 5 and 25 degrees Celsius (41 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit).
Outside this range, unprotected individuals begin to risk temperature-related injuries over hours or even minutes of activity, and fatigue (see p. 172) accrues at an accelerated rate.
Machinery fares no better, suffering degradation of function and even losing structural integrity.
Lubricants break down or congeal, battery fluids freeze, metals and plastics lose structural integrity, and increased resistance impedes normal function in electronics.
From highest to lowest, the possible temperature ranges in a normal terrestrial environment are: • Extremely Hot: Temperatures in excess of 35°C (95°F) are extremely hot.
In extremely hot temperatures, sleep and rest provide only half their normal benefit, characters require 2 additional liters of water per day, all light work counts as heavy work for purposes of fatigue, and heavy work’s fatigue effects are doubled.
In addition, the Maintenance requirements of all equipment are increased by 100%.
 
 • Hot: Conditions between 25°C and 35°C (77°F to 95°F) are considered hot for game purposes.
 In hot temperatures, characters require 1 additional liter of water per day, and heavy work’s fatigue effects are increased by 50%.
In addition, the Maintenance requirements of all equipment are increased by 50%.
 
 • Mild: The temperature range between 5°C and 25°C (41°F to 77°F) is nominal for both characters and equipment.
No penalties apply to activity in mild temperatures.

 • Cold: Between –10°C and 5°C (14°F to 41°F), characters are operating in cold conditions.
In cold conditions, rest provides only half its normal benefit, characters require 125% of their normal food intake, and heavy work’s fatigue effects are increased by 50%.
 In addition, the Maintenance requirements of all equipment are increased by 50%.
 
 • Extremely Cold: Temperatures below –10°C (14°F) are extremely cold.
Sleep is considered inactivity, and inactivity is considered light work.
The fatigue effects of heavy work are increased by 50%.
In addition, the body’s increased need to burn calories for warmth increases food requirements to 150% of normal.
Finally, the Maintenance requirements of all equipment are increased by 100%.
 
## Noise 
A certain amount of background noise is inescapable in most situations, and it’s a condition under which most individuals can function with no problem.
However, characters tend to expose themselves to painfully loud noises on a regular basis, with the possibility of both permanent and temporary hearing loss.
 
 Note that in the case of all of the following penalties to Awareness-based task checks, the rules assume that hearing is only one component of the character’s total situational awareness.
 These penalties are doubled for any task that is exclusively hearing-based, such as listening to a conversation through a wall or identifying a firearm’s caliber by the noise of a single shot.
If this generates a penalty worse than –5, the task is impossible because the ambient noise level is too high for clear perception.

 From quietest to loudest, ambient noise levels and their effects are:
 
  • Dead Silence: When the loudest audible noise is under 25 decibels (i.
e.
 whispering, human breathing, insect wings), dead silence exists.
A character with normal hearing can literally hear a pin drop in these conditions.
Dead silence provides a +1 bonus to all Awareness-based task checks that rely on hearing.
In addition, it also provides a +1 bonus to all tasks requiring prolonged concentration (GM’s discretion, but most extended tasks based on Cognition or Education should quality).

 • Quiet: Quiet background noise includes soft conversation, normal calm or breezy wind conditions, or the sounds of a deserted forest or city street at night.
In such circumstances, ambient noise ranges from 25 to 50 decibels.
Quiet is considered the default noise level and has no game effect.
 
 • Distracting: Noise levels from 50 to 80 decibels are considered distracting.
These are present in busy city streets, moderate to strong winds, crowded restaurants, the interior of normal passenger vehicles, and a gunfight involving only suppressed pistol-caliber firearms.
Distracting noise levels aren’t harmful, but do interfere with perception and concentration, inflicting a –1 penalty on relevant checks (as per Dead Silence).
 
 • Loud: Loud noise ranges from 80 to 105 decibels.
Sources of loud noise include factory machinery, large and restless crowds, gale-force or stronger winds, normal home stereo systems at maximum volume, and the operating noises of motorcycles and heavy vehicles.
Prolonged exposure to loud noise levels can cause hearing loss, but at this stage this is a roleplaying rather than mechanical effect.
Mechanically speaking, the penalties inflicted by loud noise levels rise to –2.
These penalties are persistent even after the ambient noise level drops, being reduced by 1 for every 10 minutes of lesser noise.
 
 • Industrial: Noise of 105 to 130 decibels is considered industrial-strength.
Jackhammers, heavily-customized car stereo systems, rock concerts, screaming mobs, air raid sirens, and suppressed low-caliber rifle fire all generate industrial noise.
 Noise in this range is actively painful to characters without hearing protection, and every encounter with this level of noise can cause incremental hearing loss.
The penalty inflicted by industrial noise levels is –3 and is persistent, being reduced by 1 for every 30 minutes of lesser noise.
 In addition, whenever your character suffers prolonged exposure to industrial noise, make a Fitness (TN +5) check.
If the check fails, the character permanently receives the Reduced Acuity (Hearing) disadvantage at 1 point (if he has the Increased Acuity [Hearing] advantage, its value is reduced by 1; if he already has Reduced Acuity [Hearing] at 1 point, no further damage is accrued).

 • Deafening: When noise levels exceed 130 decibels, permanent hearing loss and other physiological effects are likely to occur.
Explosions, unsuppressed gunfire, and jet engines are among the few mechanisms that can generate deafening noise.
 The penalty inflicted by deafening noise levels is –4 and is persistent, being reduced by 1 for every 1d6 hours of lesser noise.

 In addition, whenever your character suffers prolonged exposure to deafening noise, make a Fitness (TN +5) check.
If this fails, the character suffers hearing loss as described at the industrial noise level.
If the character already has the Reduced Acuity (Hearing) disadvantage at 1 point, its value is increased to 2 points.

# character traits
Like most RPGs, the Reflex System is a mathematical model of reality.
As such, it simplifies and quantifies many aspects of the real world for ease of play.
 Characters are no exception – very few people walk around with IQ test results and medical charts tattooed on their foreheads.
The traits presented in the following sections define each character’s basic capabilities in game terms.

## attributes
Every human has certain innate capabilities: movement, thought, social interaction, and so forth.
The Reflex System defines and quantifies these universal qualities with ten attributes.
 Four attributes each describe the physical and mental aspects of a character, while the last two define the character’s psychological and physiological responses to combat.
 Each attribute has a value between 1 and 15.
In general, 1 is the lowest possible level of capability that an adult human can have and still function.
  6 is human average.
10 is the upper limit of innate development.
Values above 10 are reserved for individuals who have deliberately worked for years to cultivate specific traits.

## Zero Attribute Values
Any living, functioning human has at least minimal strength in each attribute.
Consequently, a character who has a value of 0 in any attribute is dead, catatonic, paralyzed from the neck up, or otherwise not suitable for continued play.

## Awareness (AWA) 
The Reflex System assumes that every character has normal sensory acuity.
Awareness is a relative measure of the degree to which the character actually pays attention to and understands what those senses are telling him.
A character with low Awareness is unperceptive, lost inside his own head, or just plain clueless.
 A character with high Awareness is keyed in to subtle clues and details whose significance is lost on most people.
 Awareness in Skill Checks: Awareness modifies skill checks that require characters to be aware of their environments or to notice subtle details.
Typically, this will involve searches, investigations, and other tests of physical perceptiveness and sensory acuity.
 Awareness Attribute Checks: Awareness checks establish a character’s attention to detail and danger in particular situations.
 As such, an Awareness check is appropriate for noticing physical cues that may alert the character to a clue or an ambush.
## Coordination (CDN) 

 As its name suggests, Coordination measures a character’s hand-eye coordination and kinesthetic sense.
It also represents his fine motor skills and his innate understanding of two- and three- dimensional movement.
A character with high Coordination is light- fingered and precise, while a character with low Coordination tends to drop things and inflicts a lot ofsuperficial damage on his car.
 Coordination in Skill Checks: Most tasks relying on the character’s capacity for precise physical action will apply his Coordination modifier.
This includes virtually all attacks in combat, as well as delicate repair work and vehicular operation.
 Coordination Attribute Checks: Coordination checks are appropriate for actions that involve movement and physical precision not directly connected to any skill, such as catching and throwing objects.
## Fitness (FIT)
  Fitness measures the character’s endurance and the strength of his immune system.
A character with high Fitness is energetic and in good health, while one with low Fitness tires quickly and falls ill frequently.
In play, Fitness determines a character’s resistance to physical injury, carrying capacity, resistance to disease and environmental hazards, healing rate, and sustained overland movement speed.
 Fitness in Skill Checks: Fitness is an appropriate attribute to apply to any task that involves the sustained use of a physically demanding skill over an extended period of time.
Manual labor is a prime example, as is energy-intensive movement such as climbing or swimming.
 Fitness Attribute Checks: Fitness rarely comes into play for direct use.
It’s hard to take an action by being fit – this is more of a passive quality in most circumstances.
Displaying pure physical endurance and resisting infections are examples of Fitness checks.
## Muscle (MUS) 
Muscle defines the aspects of a character’s musculoskeletal system, including physical strength, muscle tone, and flexibility.
 In play, Muscle affects a character’s resistance to physical injury, carrying capacity, throwing range, and combat movement speed.
 Muscle in Skill Checks: Muscle comes into play for all actions that require overall short-term physical exertion.
Most full-body motion relies on Muscle, including personal movement in all dimensions and both armed and unarmed close combat.
 Muscle Attribute Checks: A Muscle check is appropriate when the task at hand relies solely on peak strength or full-body motion unrelated to a skill.
Breaking open a padlock, wriggling through a narrow drainpipe, and lifting a car off an accident victim all call for Muscle checks.
In addition, avoidance of many sources of passive damage calls for Muscle checks.
## Cognition (COG) 
Cognition describes the character’s capacity for logical reasoning, abstract thought, and creativity.
A character’s Cognition roughly relates to his I.
Q.
, though this is not always a direct equivalence.
Typically, though, a character’s Cognition value directly translates to what most people consider his level of intelligence or cunning.
 Cognition in Skill Checks: Intensive analysis and creative inspiration are naturally reliant on Cognition.
This includes intellectual tasks like hacking a computer system, diagnosing a mechanical malfunction, and extemporaneously composing poetry.
 Cognition Attribute Checks: Cognition represents creativity and analytical capability.
Accordingly, any attempt to figure something out without benefit of any special training is a good candidate for a Cognition check.
## Education (EDU)

Education measures the extent of the character’s learning as defined by modern education standards of the early 21st century.
A character’s Education value indirectly relates to a specific amount of completed study – a character can be assumed to benefit from a number of years of formal schooling equal to twice his Education.
 Note that the listed equivalencies aren’t hard requirements, but rather guidelines.
A self-made bibliophile is perfectly capable of educating himself to a high Education value, even if he’s never set foot on a college campus.
 Note that Education is limited in scope.
When making an attribute check, you normally roll 2d20L.
 This applies to Education checks – but only for subjects that modern primary and secondary schools consider “general education.
”This includes mathematics up to calculus, basic physical science (e.g. biology, chemistry, physics, and earth sciences), literature in the national language, and an overview of national and world history and culture.
For a more specialized subject, you roll 2d20H, the same roll made for an unskilled skill check.
This penalty can be mitigated by degrees, which are described below.
 Education in Skill Checks: Education affects any skill check that requires the character to remember factual information or to put learned theory into practice.
Most intensive medical and technical tasks fall under this classification, as do large-scale administrative efforts.
 Education Attribute Checks: An Education attribute check is called for when a character attempts pure theoretical or laboratory work.
Designing a skyscraper, drafting a constitution, and researching historical events are all tasks appropriate for Education checks.
In addition, any recall of general knowledge that doesn’t fall under the domain of a skill is a function of an Education check.

### Degrees
The Education attribute could arguably encompass knowledge of every realm of human endeavor.
In practice, a character can’t be an expert on every conceivable subject simply by virtue of an astronomical Education value.
Higher education, particularly at the post-secondary level, tends to be narrowly-focused in order to produce specialists rather than generalists.
 The Reflex System addresses this dichotomy through degrees.
For every point of Education above 6, a character receives one degree.
Each degree represents a particular field of study on which the character has focused for several years.
These degrees may roughly correspond to actual university courses of study, though they don’t have to.
A character who has a degree as per game mechanics terms doesn’t necessarily have a diploma in the same subject.
A degree can be the result of intensive professional training in a subject that no university teaches, but it also can be a consequence of decades of personal experience.
 A character may acquire multiple degrees in the same subject.
 For example, a former judge with Education 11 could have three degrees in law and two in political science.
Degrees in Play Degrees have two mechanical functions.
The first is to allow more effective use of the character’s Education value.
If a character has a degree that is directly relevant to the subject of an Education attribute check, you make the attribute check normally, rolling 2d20L.
For each additional degree of direct relevance, add one extra die.
For each degree that is indirectly or tangentially relevant, add a cumulative +1 bonus.
 Example: Colin has Education 10, with two degrees in law and one each in creative writing and drama.
He happens to find him- self appointed to draft the constitution of an independent Balkan state that’s coming out of five years of martial law.
The GM rules that this requires an Education attribute check.
Colin’s two law degrees are directly relevant to the task at hand – he’s creating the primary legal basis for the new nation’s government.
His cre- ative writing degree isn’t precisely appropriate here, but it will help him put his thoughts on paper in a clear and unambiguous style, so the GM admits that it’s indirectly relevant.
Theatre.
.
.
 not so much.
With two directly relevant degrees and one indi- rectly relevant one, Colin rolls a 3d20L Education check with a +1 bonus.
 The other function of degrees is to enhance appropriate skill checks.
When you make a skill check that primarily involves social interaction or mental recall and analysis rather than physical activity, you receive a cumulative bonus based on the number of degrees the character possesses that are relevant to the task.
Directly relevant degrees each provide a +2 bonus, while indirectly relevant ones each provide a +1 bonus.
As usual, the total cumulative bonus from degrees cannot exceed +5.
Degrees never provide bonuses to physical actions.
 Sample Degrees: Aeronautical Engineering, Agriculture, Anthropology, Archaeology, Astronomy, Biology, Business Administration, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Creative Writing, Cultural Trivia (by culture), Drama, Economics, Education, Electrical Engineering, Emergency Management, Geology, History (by time period, culture, or geographic area), Journalism, Law, Library Science, Linguistics, Literature (by culture or language), Materials Science, Mathematics, Medicine (by area of specialty), Mechanical Engineering, Meteorology, Military Science, Oceanography, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Sociology.
## Personality (PER) 
Personality encompasses a character’s capacity for social interaction and empathy.
A character with high Personality is magnetic, charismatic, and conscious of the feelings of others, whereas one with low Personality is uninteresting, rude, or terse.
 Personality is a two-way street, measuring not only the character’s ability to affect others but also his sensitivity to subtle social cues.
 Personality in Skill Checks: As the attribute that governs a character’s socialization, most attempts at interpersonal relations rely on Personality.
 Personality Attribute Checks: The social skills (see p.
 80) encompass most human interactions.
Personality itself comes into play when the character is simply “being himself” and socializing without a specific agenda.
It also serves as the social counterpart to Awareness, and is used when a character may be able to pick up cues from another individual’s demeanor, turns of phrase, or unconscious behavior.
This same function of interpersonal dynamics makes Personality the attribute that opposes all social attempts at deception.
## Resolve (RES)
Resolvedefinesacharacter’spsychologicalstabilityandmental endurance.
A character with high Resolve is driven, focused, and self-confident, but one with low Resolve is unmotivated and easily swayed or distracted.
In play, Resolve determines a character’s resistance to psychological trauma and ability to cling to life when critically injured.
 Resolve in Skill Checks: Resolve applies to actions that require protracted attention in the face of sheer boredom.
It’s also relevant to social interaction that involves displays of dedication or aggression, such as intimidation or persuasive speaking.
 Resolve Attribute Checks: Resolve is used when the character’s willpower is the dominant determining factor in a situation.
This includes resistance to social interaction designed to change the character’s behavior, as well as recovery from major injuries.
## Coolness Under Fire (CUF)
Coolness Under Fire represents a character’s capacity to override his basic mammalian survival instincts.
This comes from a combination of trained reflex, self-control, and willingness to accept injury as a consequence of action.
To a certain extent, Coolness Under Fire can be considered a “courage attribute,” though it only addresses the limited subset of courage in the face of immediate physical danger (moral rectitude and similar forms of courage are roleplaying decisions or functions of Resolve).
A character with a high CUF can unflinchingly face threats that freeze less stalwart comrades in their tracks or send them scurrying for cover.
 CUF in Skill Checks: CUF is never applied to skill checks, except in limited circumstances dictated by specific combat rules.
 CUF Attribute Checks: A CUF check determines the character’s ability to resist fear of death or injury.
Accordingly, CUF checks occur only in specific circumstances determined by combat events – see Chapter Five.
## Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) 
Observe-Orient-Decide-Act determines how quickly a character can react to sudden, unexpected events, usually violent ones.
This primarily stems from mental flexibility, but physical reflex speed is also a consideration.
A character with a high OODA can respond to a threat at the drop of a proverbial hat while counterparts with lower OODA are still standing slack-jawed.
 OODA in Skill Checks: OODA is never applied to skill checks, except in limited circumstances dictated by specific combat rules.
 OODA Attribute Checks: As with CUF, OODA checks occur only in specific circumstances determined by combat conditions, as described in Chapter Five.
The most common use of OODA is to determine the speed with which a character acts in combat.
# skills [stopped here]
In addition to the innate qualities that attributes portray, a character also learns certain specific capabilities throughout the course of his life.
The Reflex System represents this practical experience in performing various tasks with skills.
 Each skill has a value, which is a numerical representation of a character’s total experience in using it (each point of skill value roughly corresponds to one year of steady work toward improvement).
At the beginning of the character creation process, a character has a value of 0 in every skill.
Each skill also has a rating, which is derived from its value as per the following table.
 The skill’s rating determines the number of dice that you roll when Table 3h: Skill Ratings Qualifications Many skills encompass broad areas of human endeavor.
In the case of some of these skills, it is not realistic to assume that a character who is trained in the basics of the skill, even to a high degree of proficiency, is familiar with all possible nuances of the skill.
Qualifications represent the borders or fringe cases of a skill.
In a case where a base skill allows a limited range of actions, a qualification expands the ways in which a character can apply that skill.
For example, not all doctors are thoracic surgeons, so the base Medicine skill does not include surgical techniques.
However, a character with the Medicine/Surgery qualification is qualified to perform such invasive procedures.
 Some skill checks require any character that attempts them to have one (or, very rarely, more) qualification for optimum results.
 It is possible, albeit difficult and often dangerous, to attempt a task without possessing a qualification that it requires.
If a character attempts any such task without all required qualifications, his effective rating in the skill is reduced by three levels (a penalty equal to that inflicted by a serious wound).
 Example: Erin and Shane both have Expert ratings in Medicine.
 However, Erin also has the Medicine/Surgery qualification, while Shane does not.
If presented with a task that requires Medicine/ Surgery, Erin applies her normal skill rating, but Shane attempts the roll as if he only had a Novice skill rating.
 WiththeGM’sapproval,acharactermayacquireaqualification of the player’s own devising in order to represent unusual proficiency with a rare or unusual aspect of a skill that normally would fall outside common modernly-practiced knowledge.
Such qualifications should be limited in scope and utility.
We caution the GM to be wary of players who request combat-useful custom qualifications for non-combat skills (i.
e.
 Animal Husbandry/War Elephants, Construction/Medieval Siege Engines, Electronics/ Particle Beam Weapons).
 Cascade Skills Several skills are designated as cascade skills.
These skills encompass a wide variety of unrelated tasks.
A character must acquire a cascade skill separately for each specific task or area of endeavor.
For example, the Perform cascade skill governs attempts to entertain and inform.
A character might have the Perform (Acting), Perform (Drums), and Perform (Guitar) skills, and would be a skilled actor, drummer, and guitarist; however, none of his Perform cascades would be of use if he attempted to start a career as an opera singer.
 The lists of specific cascades presented with each cascade skill are illustrative, not exhaustive.
Players should feel free to ask the GM about new and unique cascades that fit their character concepts.
However, the GM should feel equally free to veto any cascades that are too narrowly-focused, too widely-focused, too unbalancing for combat purposes, or generally inappropriate for the game.
 Social Skills The category of “social skills” includes Command, Deception, Instruction, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion.
All of these skills, to one degree or another, deal with interpersonal relations.
In many situations, a character can apply more than one of these skills to achieve the same end result.
 The difference in such a case is in the method used.
For example, if a character wants to induce a witness to keep silent, he could use Command (appealing to her sense of duty and respect for authority), Deception (confusing her understanding of the situation), Intimidation (frightening her into silence), or Persuasion (bribing her or otherwise convincing her that staying quiet will be advantageous for her).
Depending on the target and the situation, some approaches will work better than others.
The GM is the final arbiter on how a given NPC will react to one method of social interaction over another.
 Skill Descriptions Agriculture One of the oldest skills and one of the most basic to human survival, Agriculture deals with the raising of crops for sustenance and raw materials.
Planting, tending, harvesting, storage, and basic preparation for use all fall under this skill.
Agriculture also encompasses the use and maintenance of associated farm machinery, such as threshers and cultivators.
 Typical Actions: Assessing the condition of crops, soil, or agricultural facilities is a simple action (AWA).
Tending crops is an incremental action (COG) with a period measured in weeks; usually, the total amount of time available for this action is limited by the local growing season.
Harvesting crops is an incremental action (FIT for manual labor, CDN with mechanical assistance).
 Animal Husbandry Almost as old as Agriculture, Animal Husbandry involves the care, feeding, and breeding of living creatures for food or work.
 This skill also includes basic practical knowledge of veterinary medicine, though anything more complicated than minor illness or slight wounds requires the Medicine/Veterinary qualification.
 Typical Actions: Assessing the condition and value of an animal is a simple action (AWA).
Breeding, raising, and tending animals are all incremental actions (COG) with periods measured in weeks or months, depending on how rapidly the animals in question mature.
Slaughtering and butchering an animal for food or other products is a simple action (MUS).
 Aquatics This skill encompasses a set of related capabilities for maneuvering on and in the water, including both swimming and the handling of small watercraft (anything 20 meters or less in length).
A character skilled in Aquatics is also versed in survival in open water.
 Typical Actions: Staying afloat and moving on the surface of the water is a simple action (MUS).
A character’s maximum swimming speed in meters per tick is equal to the number of dice he rolls for Aquatics tasks (so a character with a Professional rating swims at 3 meters per tick).
Maneuvering a watercraft is a simple action (MUS for manually- and wind-powered craft, CDN for motorized ones).
Fishing is a simple action (RES).
 SCUBA Qualification: This qualification represents training in the use of underwater breathing gear for dives down to about 50 meters.
Swimming with SCUBA gear is similar to ordinary swimming: a simple action (MUS).
Recharging and maintaining SCUBA gear is a simple action (COG).
 Archery A skilled archer is capable of using and maintaining bows and crossbows, as well as creating ammunition for them.
Creating a new bow or crossbow is a function of the Artisan (Bowyer) cascade.
 Typical Actions: Making arrows or bolts from raw materials is a simple action (COG).
Attacks are detailed in Chapter Six.
 Artillery Artillery governs the use and maintenance of indirect-fire modern weapons, including rockets, howitzers, and mortars.
The basic skill provides proficiency only with “dumb” or unguided munitions.
 Typical Actions: Attacks with artillery weapons are detailed in Chapter Six.
 Performing maintenance or repairs on an artillery piece is a simple action (COG).
Calling for or adjusting fire as a forward observer is a simple action (COG).
 Guided Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in the targeting and use of advanced guided munitions.
 All uses of Artillery with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Artisan (Cascade) Artisan covers a wide variety of skill sets related to the creation of works of physical or literary beauty and of simple functional objects.
Many Artisan cascades are archaic and were largely replaced by mass production in the pre-Last War world, but their remaining practitioners are now in high demand after centuries of decline.
At the GM’s discretion, a Artisan cascade may cover a specific sub-set of the Mechanics skill, such as gunsmithing or machining.
 Typical Actions: Creating a functional object or work of art is either an instant or incremental action, depending on the item’s complexity (variable attributes, depending on the nature of the act of creation).
Appraising an item is a simple action (EDU), as is critiquing a work of art (COG).
 Sample Cascades: Basketry, Blacksmithing, Bowyery, Brewing, Carpentry, Cinematography, Fiction Writing, Gem Cutting, Glassblowing, Glasscutting, Gunsmithing, Knitting, Leatherworking,Locksmithing,Machining,Painting,Photography, Poetry, Sculpture, Silversmithing, Tailoring, Videography, Watchsmithing, Welding, Woodcarving.
 Aviation This skill governs all actions related to powered flight.
The basic Aviation skill enables the character to pilot all light airplanes (subsonic passenger or cargo craft possessing fixed wings and no more than two engines).
Various qualifications, in the most literal sense, indicate that the pilot is type-qualified on more complex airframes.
In addition, Aviation covers air navigation and basic preventive maintenance, though any heavy maintenance or repair work requires the Mechanics/Aviation qualification.
 Typical Actions: Maneuvering an aircraft is a simple action (CDN).
Preflight inspections and preventive maintenance are both simple actions (respectively AWA and COG).
 Heavy Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on heavy and multi-engine fixed-wing aircraft (those possessing more than two engines).
All uses of Aviation with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Performance Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on aerobatic jets and combat aircraft.
All uses of Aviation with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Rotary Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on helicopters.
All uses of Aviation with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Remote Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), enabling remote operation of all aircraft that the character could normally fly.
All uses of Aviation with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Climbing Climbing encompasses all attempts to ascend and descend surfaces or solid objects, including trees, ropes, cargo nets, rock walls, and so forth.
In addition, a character skilled in Climbing knows how to rig and maintain harnesses, ropes, and other climbing gear, including improvising temporary gear from available materials.
 Typical Actions: Ascending or descending is a simple action (MUS).
A character’s maximum ascent speed is equal to half the number of dice he rolls for Climbing tasks (so a character with a Professional rating ascends at 2 meters per tick).
A character’s maximum descent speed is equal to the number of dice he rolls for Climbing tasks, plus his Muscle attribute value.
Rigging climbing equipment is a simple action (COG).
 Command The art of issuing orders that social or organizational subordinates (and, on occasion, superiors) will obey is the essence of Command.
This skill also includes the ability to efficiently organize groups and delegate individual parts of the total group effort.
 Typical Actions: Organizing a large-scale effort is an incremental action that occurs in conjunction with all the other actions involved with the effort (PER or EDU, depending on whether the work is primarily physical or intellectual).
Inspiring an audience to adopt a certain course of action through leadership and example is a simple action (PER).
Rallying a panicked ally is a simple action (RES).
In addition, leadership of a large-scale project involving dozens of participants is dependent on Command (see sidebar).
 Computing A character skilled in Computing knows how to work with computer systems tomakethem function asdesigned.
 Thisincludes the use of all modern methods of input: mouse and keyboard interaction, touch-screens, voice recognition, retinal tracking, and gesture recognition.
With the diverse array of operating systems and applications on the market in the early 2010s, Computing enables a character not only to use familiar systems, but also to intuit the manner in which unfamiliar ones operate.
 Additionally, this skill includes a basic familiarity with computer hardware and its installation and maintenance.
 Typical Actions: Using an application is an instant or incremental action (EDU), depending on the complexity of the task the character wants to accomplish.
Hacking a secure system is an incremental action (COG).
Setting up, breaking down, and maintaining computer hardware are all simple actions.
Setting up a network is an incremental action (COG) requiring one successful check per computer on the network.
Falsifying electronic data is an incremental action (COG).
Creating a mathematical code is an incremental action (EDU).
Discovering falsified data and breaking a code are likewise incremental actions (respectively, COG and EDU), each of which has a target total equal to the number of successful checks that the original forger or encoder made.
 Programming Qualification: This qualification represents formal or informal training in the creation and modification of software.
It includes a working knowledge of a handful of modern programming languages, as well as general design theory.
 Additional Computing tasks possible with this qualification include reprogramming existing applications and creating new ones, both incremental actions (COG).
 Construction The creation, maintenance, repair, and destruction of structures all fall under Construction.
This skill encompasses related tasks that fall under both civil engineering and combat engineering professions (the purely academic aspects of civil engineering are functions of Education).
 Typical Actions: Assessing the physical condition of a structure, including its load-bearing ability, suitability as shelter, potential for salvage after demolition, and value for concealment or cover, is a simple action (AWA).
Building a structure from plans is an incremental action (MUS for physical labor, CDN for mechanized labor).
Improvising a temporary structure is an incremental action (MUS for physical labor, CDN for mechanized labor).
 Safely demolishing a structure to salvage raw materials is an incremental action (MUS for physical labor, CDN for mechanized labor).
 Demolition Qualification: This qualification represents specific training in the use of explosives.
Rigging charges to demolish a specific structure is a simple action (COG).
Creating an improvised explosive device (IED) is a simple action (CDN).
 Disabling a charge or defusing an IED is a simple action (COG), or an incremental action (RES) if the item is booby-trapped.
 Creating new explosive material from raw chemicals is a function of the Education attribute and appropriate degrees.
 Deception All attempts to intentionally distort the truth for any purpose other than entertainment fall under Deception (entertainment assumes a willing audience and is a function of various cascades of the Performance skill).
 Typical Actions: Telling a single lie or set of lies is a simple action (PER).
 Maintaining an extended lie, such as a cover identity, is an incremental action (RES).
Most attempts at Deception are opposed by the audience’s Personality attribute, as recognizing a lie is a basic function of empathy and interpersonal relations.
 However, a skilled bullshit artist may use a Deception (PER) skill check in place of a Personality check to determine if someone else is lying to him.
 Driving Driving involves the use of most ground vehicles.
The basic Driving skill enables the character to drive most light passenger and cargo vehicles (those with 4 to 10 wheels and up to 10 meters in length).
Various qualifications indicate that the driver is also capable of controlling more complex or esoteric types of vehicles.
 In addition, Driving covers basic preventive maintenance, though any heavy maintenance or repair work requires the Mechanics skill.
 Typical Actions: Maneuvering a ground vehicle is a simple action (CDN).
Preventive maintenance and general inspections are both simple actions (respectively COG and AWA).
 Heavy Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on heavy wheeled vehicles, roughly corresponding to those requiring a commercial driver’s license.
This includes buses, heavy trucks, and articulated vehicles (e.g. tractor-trailer rigs), as well as wheeled armored fighting vehicles (AFVs).
All uses of Driving with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Motorcycle Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on motorcycles and similar vehicles (e.g.snowmobiles).
All uses of Driving with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Remote Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), enabling remote operation of all ground vehicles that the character could normally drive.
All uses of Driving with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 TrackedQualification:Thisqualificationrepresentsadditional training on tracked vehicles such as construction equipment and AFVs.
All uses of Driving with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Electronics The repair, maintenance, and modification of electrical and electronic device falls under this skill.
 Typical Actions:  Maintenance of an electronic device is a simple action (COG).
Repair of a damaged electronic device is an incremental action (COG), as is building a new device from loose components.
 Fieldcraft Fieldcraft encompasses basic wilderness survival skills: overland navigation, finding or building shelter, avoiding terrain hazards, locating and purifying water, foraging for food, fishing (also an Aquatics task), searching for abandoned equipment or supplies, and interpreting wild animal behavior.
In addition, this skill also governs attempts to avoid detection in a wilderness or deserted urban environment (stealth in a populated area is a function of Streetcraft).
 Typical Actions: Stealthy movement is a simple action (AWA).
Camouflaging a position or a stationary structure, vehicle, or character is also a simple action (AWA).
Most survival- and scrounging-related applications of Fieldcraft are detailed in Chapter Six.
 Forensics More properly termed “forensic science,” Forensics is the practical application of several disparate sciences and investigative techniques for the purpose of discovering past events through physical evidence.
Graphology (handwriting analysis), fingerprinting, photo and audio interpretation, and ballistic analysis are all tasks governed by Forensics.
 This skill also includes a practical knowledge of the laws regarding evidence collection and analysis in the society in which the character received training in this skill.
Forensics does not include detailed knowledge of how to perform autopsies (a function of the Medicine/Surgery qualification) or conduct interviews (a task for various social skills).
 Typical Actions: Gathering physical evidence from a crime scene or other location is an incremental action (AWA).
Analyzing and interpreting evidence once it’s gathered is an incremental action (EDU).
Conducting an intensive search of a small area for a single specific item is a simple action (AWA).
 ForgeryQualification:Thisqualificationrepresentsknowledge of the techniques for counterfeiting documents, currency, or works of art.
 Creating any such item is an incremental action (EDU).
 Freefall This skill defines a character’s ability to maneuver himself in the absence of apparent gravity, most commonly when skydiving.
It also covers the use of parachutes to end a freefall experience in a survivable fashion, as well as the maintenance and preparation of parachutes and related equipment.
The basic Freefall skill covers standard parachute jumps from altitudes between 300 and 4,000 meters.
It also deals with maneuvering personal aircraft such as hang gliders and ultralights, whose aerodynamic characteristics are similar to those of a parachutist.
 Typical Actions: Packing a chute for a jump is a simple action (COG).
Making a successful jump from a standard altitude is a simple action (MUS if the character can see, RES if he’s relying on instruments).
 Tactical Qualification: This qualification enables the character to make jumps from altitudes above 4,000 meters in relative safety, using both high-altitude/low-opening (HALO) and high-altitude/high-opening (HAHO) techniques.
In addition, the character can make jumps from altitudes below 300 meters with at least some chance of survival (cumulative -1 penalty for every 30 meters below 300).
Finally, the character knows how to rig vehicles and cargo pallets for parachute drops, making a separate simple action (COG) for each item to be dropped.
 Gunnery Gunnery governs the use and maintenance of direct-fire weapons that the operator does not use in a hands-on mode.
In most cases, this involves vehicle-mounted weapons such as a tank’s main gun or a strike fighter’s under-wing rocket pods, but it also covers towed antitank and antiaircraft guns.
 The basic skill provides proficiency only with “dumb” or unguided munitions.
 Typical Actions: Attacks with vehicle-mounted and similar weapons are detailed in Chapter Six.
Performing maintenance or repairs on one is a simple action (COG).
 Guided Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in the targeting and use of advanced guided munitions, such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and torpedoes.
All uses of Gunnery with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Hand-to-Hand Hand-to-Hand is unarmed combat: punches, kicks, elbow jabs, headbutts, bites, fingernail rakes and gouges, and any other means of inflictingpersonalinjurywithoutbenefitoftools.
Thisskillencompasses a wide variety of martial arts, as well as general street-learned mayhem.
 Specific styles are a matter of description rather than mechanics.
 Typical Actions: As per Chapter Five.
 Grappling Qualification: The character has additional specialized training in bare-handed grappling maneuvers intended to exert control over an opponent’s freedom of movement.
 Hand Weapons This skill covers the use of tools designed for close combat, as well as the improvisational application of anything else that one character can use to club, stab, slash, or impale another.
As with Hand-to-Hand, specific schools or techniques are descriptive rather than mechanical in nature.
 Typical Actions: As per Chapter Five.
 Grappling Qualification: The character has additional specialized training in armed grappling maneuvers intended to exert control over an opponent’s freedom of movement.
 Instruction Instruction governs attempts to teach a skill or qualification to another character, as well as coaching another character in efforts to improve an attribute or otherwise gain additional knowledge or training.
If the character is a professional educator, Instruction also provides formal knowledge of learning theory and different instructional techniques.
 Typical Actions: Training another character is detailed in Chapter Six.
 Intimidation The character’s capacity for gaining social dominance and eliciting compliance through implicit or explicit threats is determined by his Intimidation rating.
In almost all cases, use of Intimidation is considered “negative social interaction,” and can have long-term consequences on the character’s relationship with his subject.
 Typical Actions: Threatening someone is a simple action (MUS for physical displays, RES for verbal threats), opposed by the subject’s Resolve.
 Language (Cascade) Each Language cascade is a separate language in which the character has some degree of literacy or proficiency.
These may be current languages (e.g. English, Spanish), dead languages (e.g. Ancient Egyptian, Latin), or even non-auditory modes of communication (e.g. lip reading, American Sign Language).
 Limited hand sign vocabularies developed for a specific context are  functions of the closest appropriate skill (e.g. Tactics for military tactical signals, Streetcraft for gang signs).
 The character’s degree of fluency is determined by his skill rating.
A Novice rating allows pidgin communication with short, declarative sentences.
A Competent rating enables the character to carry on a normal conversation in the language, so long as the topic doesn’t involve specialized technical fields.
A Professional rating gives the character an elevated vocabulary and, if the language is not his native tongue, allows him to speak idiomatically with a native accent.
Higher ratings indicate greater degrees of formal linguistic study and/or native-like familiarity.
 Typical Actions: In most cases, communication doesn’t require a skill check, unless the subject matter’s complexity exceeds the character’s fluency.
In such an event, a simple action (COG) is required.
Attempting to pass as a native speaker requires a simple action (PER), opposed by the listener’s Awareness (if a native speaker) or equivalent skill check (if not a native speaker; PER).
If the character doesn’t speak the same language as his listener, but both characters have languages with common linguistic ancestry, a simple action (COG) is required for each party.
Creating or breaking a linguistic code (as opposed to a mathematical cipher) is an incremental action (EDU).
 Sample Cascades: Any spoken or sign language, subject to the GM’s approval.
 Longarm Longarm governs marksmanship with any firearm designed for two-handed shoulder-fired operation.
For game purposes, this includes all rifles, shotguns, submachine guns, and squad automatic weapons.
It also encompasses basic maintenance on such weapons, though any detailed repair or modification requires Mechanics or Artisan (Gunsmithing).
 Typical Actions: Attacks with firearms are detailed in Chapter Five.
Maintaining a firearm is a simple action (COG).
 Mechanics The Mechanics skill covers the maintenance and repair of all mechanical equipment.
The basic skill covers all commonly- available items that can be maintained with normal hand tools and have a level of complexity equal to or less than that of an internal combustion engine.
Qualifications expand this expertise to other specialized types of mechanical equipment.
 Typical Actions: Evaluating damage or diagnosing a malfunction is a simple action (AWA).
Repairing damage or a malfunction is an incremental action (CDN for small items, MUS for large equipment).
 Aviation Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in aircraft engines, airframes, and associated mechanisms.
 Industrial Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in large-scale fixed installations, such as climate control systems, elevators, and other “physical plant” equipment, as well as heavy factory or cargo-handling machinery.
 Machinist Qualification: This qualification enables the character to create new mechanical parts, given appropriate tools and raw materials.
 Nautical Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in ship propulsion and steering systems and other technologies unique to naval architecture.
 Medicine The diagnosis and treatment of injuries and illness are the province of Medicine.
The basic skill encompasses first aid, extended care, and the capabilities common to a skilled emergency medic or a doctor in general practice.
More specific capabilities come with additional qualifications.
 Typical Actions: Treating injuries and illnesses is detailed in Chapters Five and Six.
Conducting a cursory inspection of a dead body is a simple action (AWA).
 Surgery Qualification: This qualification represents training in surgical procedures, enabling the character to perform surgery as detailed in Chapter Six.
Additionally, the character can conduct autopsies as an incremental action (EDU).
 Veterinary Qualification: This qualification represents education in veterinary medicine, enabling the character to treat injuries and illnesses in animals using the same game mechanics that apply to human patients.
At the GM’s discretion, a character who is primarily a veterinarian may receive this qualification for free, but may not use the Medicine skill on human patients without an equivalent “Non-Veterinary” qualification.
 Mounts This skill includes the care, feeding, training, and riding of animals.
At the GM’s discretion, a penalty of up to –4 may apply if a character tries to use this skill with an animal not native to his culture of origin (for example, a Montana native attempting to ride an elephant).
This skill also includes basic practical knowledge of veterinary medicine, though anything more complicated than minor illness or slight wounds requires the Medicine/Veterinary qualification.
 Typical Actions: Maneuvering a mount is a simple action (MUS).
Training a mount is an incremental action (RES).
 Teamster Qualification: This qualification represents experience in the training and control of draft animals pulling vehicles such as wagons or buggies.
Maneuvering such a conveyance is a simple action (CDN).
 Performance (Cascade) This skill describes a character’s capacity to deliver an entertaining or informative performance, whether live or recorded.
 Each cascade represents a separate performing art, instrument, or genre.
 Typical Actions: Performing is either an instant or incremental action, depending on the performance’s duration and complexity (variable attributes, depending on the nature of the act, but typically MUS for physical performances, PER for verbal ones, and RES for musical ones).
Critiquing or evaluating someone else’s performance is a simple action (EDU).
 Sample Cascades: Ballet, Broadcast News, Ceremonial Drill, Comedy Acting, Country and Western Singing, Disguise (opposed by an observer’s Awareness if used outside an entertainment context), Dramatic Acting, Guitar, Opera, Pantomime, Public Address, Rap, Saxophone, Stand-Up Comedy, Stunts, Torture.
 Persuasion Persuasion governs acts of sweet reason – in other words, attempts to convince another individual that a different perspective or course of action is in his own best interest.
 Typical Actions: Ordinary one-way persuasion is a simple action (PER) opposed by the target’s Resolve attribute.
However, a skilled salesman may use a Persuasion (RES) skill check in place of a Resolve check to recognize and ignore a persuasive argument.
 Mutual persuasive attempts, including debate and barter, are simple contested actions (PER).
Gathering rumors on the street is a simple action (PER).
 Psychiatry Qualification: This qualification represents expertise in psychology and psychiatry, enabling the character to diagnose and treat psychological trauma and mental illness (as detailed in Chapter Six).
 Seamanship Seamanship measures a character’s skill in controlling large water vessels.
The basic skill allows the use of motorized surface vessels larger than 20 meters in length (smaller vessels fall under Aquatics).
Various qualifications indicate that the seaman is also capable of controlling more complex or esoteric types of craft.
In addition, Seamanship grants the ability to find specific compartments or resources on board a vessel which may have more interior volume than a small town.
 Typical Actions: Maneuvering a ship is a simple action (COG).
 Searching for supplies and equipment within a large vessel is a scrounging task, as detailed in Chapter Six.
 Remote Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on unmanned seagoing and submersible vehicles (USVs), enabling remote operation of all large watercraft that the character could normally pilot.
 All uses of Seamanship with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Sailing Qualification: This qualification grants familiarity with the operation of sailing ships, including a great deal of obscure nautical terminology that can be used to confuse or impress the uninitiated.
All uses of Seamanship with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Submersible Qualification: This qualification enables the character to control submarines.
All uses of Seamanship with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill, except that maneuvering a submarine is a simple action (COG).
 Security All attempts to install, bypass, or disable the mechanisms that restrict physical access to a place or item fall under this skill.
 Simple padlocks, electronic keypads, retinal scanners, handcuffs, pressure pads, and automobile ignitions are all considered security mechanisms.
 Typical Actions: Installing a security system is either an instant or incremental action (COG), depending on the complexity and size of the system.
Bypassing or disabling a security system is an incremental action (CDN for mechanical systems, COG for electronic ones).
 Sidearm Sidearm governs marksmanship with any firearm designed for one-handed operation, including all handguns and machine pistols.
It also encompasses basic maintenance on such weapons, though any detailed repair or modification requires Mechanics or Artisan (Gunsmithing).
 Typical Actions: Attacks with firearms are detailed in Chapter Five.
Maintaining a firearm is a simple action (COG).
 Special Equipment (Cascade) This skill is a catch-all cascade for specialized technological knowledge that doesn’t readily fall under any other skill.
Each cascade of Special Equipment encompasses the operation and basic maintenance of a separate type of device.
If you so desire, a cascade is allowed to encompass equipment that more properly belongs to another skill.
For example, Special Equipment (Medical Diagnostic Instruments) could also be considered a function of Medicine, as such implements are directly related to common medical procedures.
However, a character derives no special benefit from having a Special Equipment cascade that is a subset of another skill.
 The GM has final approval over all Special Equipment cascades.
 Typical Actions: GM’s discretion, depending on the equipment in question.
 Sample Cascades: Astronomy Instruments, Blast Furnaces, Chemical Plants, Commercial Radio Transmitters, Deep-Space Radar, Firefighting Gear, Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, Medical Diagnostic Instruments, Military Communication Gear, Mining Equipment, Nuclear Power Plants, Oil Drilling Platforms, Television Broadcast Equipment.
 Special Vehicle (Cascade) This skill is a catch-all for specialized or unique vehicles whose operation doesn’t readily fall under any other skill.
Each cascade of Special Vehicle encompasses the operation and basic maintenance of a separate type of vehicle.
The GM has final approval over all cascades of this skill.
 Typical Actions: Maneuvers will be the most typical action for which this skill is used.
As with all other vehicular maneuvers, these are simple actions (attributes dependent on the specific vehicle type, but most likely CDN).
 Sample Cascades: Apollo Capsule, Caspian Sea Monster, Hot- Air Balloon, Hovercraft, Space Shuttle, Train, Zeppelin.
 Remote Qualification: This qualification represents additional training on the vehicle covered by the cascade for which the qualification was purchased, enabling the character to remotely operate it.
This qualification must be purchased separate for each cascade to which it applies.
 Streetcraft Streetcraft is a working knowledge of the ways in which urban areas are laid out and how their infrastructures and societies function.
Navigation in unfamiliar cities falls under this skill, as does a general intuition for where a specific sort of place (e.g. game store, pizza parlor, hospital, Territorial Army armory) is likely to be located.
In a deserted urban area, Streetcraft enables the character to scavenge food, water, shelter, and supplies.
In a populated urban area, Streetcraft is used to avoid detection or evade pursuit.
 Typical Actions: Stealthy movement through a crowd is a simple action (PER), as is stealthy movement through an urban or suburban area (AWA).
Street navigation is a simple action (AWA).
 Most survival- and scrounging-related applications of Streetcraft are detailed in Chapter Six.
 Support Weapons Support Weapons enables the character to use man-portable direct-fire heavy weapons, including grenade launchers, medium and heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers.
 The basic skill provides proficiency only with “dumb” or unguided munitions.
 Typical Actions: Attacks with support weapons are detailed in Chapter Five.
Performing maintenance or repairs on one is a simple action (COG).
 Guided Qualification: This qualification represents additional training in the targeting and use of advanced guided munitions, such as ATGMs and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles (SAMs).
 All uses of Support Weapons with this qualification are the same as those of the basic skill.
 Tactics The study of combat above an individual scale, up to roughly battalion-sized engagements (e.g. several hundred combatants on each side), is the focus of Tactics.
While it does include a certain degree of theoretical knowledge of military science, Tactics primarily deals with a practical understanding of the correct actions to take (and the correct orders to give subordinates) before and during a specific combat situation.
In addition, this skill is used for general military tasks that are common to virtually every uniformed serviceman, such as emplacing directional mines, digging fighting positions, and following the rules and customs of military courtesy.
Characters who are not professional soldiers are still likely to pick up this sort of thing in the course of their studies, at least in an academic sense.
 Typical Actions: Analyzing a battle as it unfolds, or determining the correct response to a given tactical situation, is a simple action (AWA if the character is involved in the fight, EDU for a textbook or sand table exercise).
Determining the intentions of an enemy commander from available intelligence is a simple action (COG) opposed by the enemy’s own Tactics check (COG).
 Calling for or adjusting fire as a forward observer is a simple action (COG, also possible with the Artillery skill).
Using tactical hand signals to communicate non-verbally is a simple action (COG).
 Ambushes are detailed in Chapter Five.
 rank Militaries, law enforcement agencies, and some intelligence services use a hierarchy of rank to determine each member’s responsibilities and relative authority over other personnel.
For the purposes of the Reflex System, the Rank trait is relevant mainly during character creation, as it determines the opportunities and resources available to a character through his position within this hierarchy.
After the end of the world, Rank becomes much less relevant, as anyone can pin stars on his collar and style himself a general.
Some play groups, particularly those with a strong military focus, may choose for their characters to recognize their pre-Collapse ranks among themselves, but this is not mandatory.
 For game purposes, Rank comes from five different sources: •Enlisted Military •Commissioned Military •Local Police •National Police •Espionage As a character trait, Rank has a value and, in most cases, a rating.
A character in a life path phase that grants Rank begins with a Rank value of 1.
Unless otherwise specified, a character may have Rank from only one source at a time.
If he receives Rank from another source, his Rank value resets to 1.
Rank has a maximum value of 7 in all cases except Enlisted Military, which has a maximum value of 8.
 Example: Max is an experienced police officer with Rank 4.
He decides on a career change, resigning from his department and becoming a federal law enforcement agent.
Max loses his exist- ing Police Rank 4 and gains National Police Rank 1.
 The following table depicts the Rank values and ratings for American military branches and police.
Military aficionados will note that the high end of the commissioned military scale and the low end of the enlisted military scale have been compressed somewhat.
In practice, we don’t expect to see many flag-grade officers running around the post-apocalyptic wasteland, and the lowest enlisted ranks are typically reserved for individuals with less training and experience than a starting PC.
 local police rank Value Police Officer Table 3i: Local Police Ranks National law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies do not have titles directly linked to their rank structures.
 Characters with Rank from such sources have only a Rank value, not a rating.
 survival points The world of Twilight: 2013 is a harsh and unforgiving one.
 Most of the planet’s population died in the events of the last three years.
Those who remain had some natural advantage, be it skill, preparation, or blind luck.
Survival points (SPs) represent this latter quality, giving players a last-ditch mechanism with which to mitigate the impact of unfavorable die rolls.
 At character creation, a new PC enters play with his maximum possible number of SPs.
This maximum is dependent on his age, as discussed in the character creation rules (see p.
 90).
 using sps You may spend one or more SPs for various effects: Mitigate Injury At the time your character suffers an injury (physical or psychological), you may spend one or more SPs.
Each SP reduces the severity of injury to one hit location by one stage.
For example, if your character suffers a serious wound to his left arm and a critical wound to his head, you may spend a total of 5 SPs to reduce both of these to slight wounds.
This expenditure must occur when the injury occurs – it cannot be used retroactively to heal injuries previously suffered.
 The GM may disallow this use of SPs in any situation in which no remotely plausible amount of luck will save a character from certain death.
Likewise, if your character has willingly engaged in an act of self-sacrifice, you can’t use SPs to escape the consequences of such a decision.
 Boost Check After making any task check, you may spend one or more SPs to add a +4 bonus to the check for each SP spent.
Each SP spent in this manner counts as a separate bonus source, and normal skill rating limits on maximum separate bonuses still apply.
Thus, if you make a check using a skill with a Professional rating, you can spend a maximum of 3 SPs to gain a trio of +4 bonuses.
 Ignore Fatigue and Wound Penalties Before making any task check, you may spend one SP to remove the effect of all of your character’s fatigue and wound penalties from that check.
Alternately, you may spend one SP at the beginning of a movement action to remove the effect of all of your character’s fatigue wound penalties from that movement (other penalties such as encumbrance still apply).
 Aid Treatment After anyone makes a Medicine skill check involving treatment of your character, you may spend one or more SPs to add a +4 bonus to the check for each SP spent.
 Each SP spent in this manner counts as a separate bonus source, and normal skill rating limits on maximum separate bonuses still apply.
This is the only instance in which you may spend SPs to affect the action of another player’s character.
 Reduce Threat Level At any time, you may spend one or more SPs to reduce your character’s threat level (see p.
 160).
Each SP spent lowers your character’s threat level by 2 for the remainder of the scene.
 earning sps You earn SPs during play for heroic or entertaining contributions to the game, either in or out of character.
At the beginning of the campaign, the GM should choose one or more of the following guidelines for awarding SPs, depending on which player behavior he wants to reward.
 At no time may any character have more SPs than his age-limited maximum number.
 Crisis Survival At the conclusion of any combat scene in which any opponent used lethal force, each involved character earns one SP.
The GM may extend this award to other scenes that did not involve combat but in which the PCs faced equally lethal threats.
 Heroism At the conclusion of any combat (or equivalently dangerous) scene in which a PC displayed conspicuous gallantry, that character earns one SP.
“Conspicuous gallantry” is a relative term, given the heroics in which some players have their characters engage on a weekly basis.
 To avoid “SP inflation,” we recommend setting the bar just below the level of heroism displayed by most Medal of Honor or Victoria Cross winners.
 Entertainment The point of the game is entertainment (at least, we hope you aren’t using the Reflex System for business purposes).
Accordingly, if a player manages to evoke an emotional reaction from the entire group through masterful roleplaying, that player earns one SP.
Dramatic and inspiring monologues, in-character historical anecdotes, and poignant death scenes are all appropriate – in short, if the group collectively laughs, cries, or holds its breath, the player probably deserves an SP.
 The GM may choose to withhold such awards in situations where the player, though technically playing his character as defined, is actively disruptive to the group as a whole.
 Asshattery should not be rewarded.
 Story Contribution If a player makes a significant contribution to the story, he earns one SP.
 Such contributions can come in many forms.
 In general, if the player makes a dazzling intuitive leap or displays a degree of fiendish creativity that results in a major plot development, he probably deserves an SP.
 This is especially true if the player accidentally takes a plot in a direction that, in the GM’s private opinion, was better than what he originally had scripted.
.
.
 As above, the GM may choose to withhold such awards for actions that technically create progress but are disruptive or otherwise detract from the group’s enjoyment of the game.
 Character Before Numbers If a player deliberately puts his character at a numeric disadvantage for the sake of roleplaying or image, he earns one SP.
 This should be a fairly significant sacrifice that has no benefit in game mechanics.
A character who takes off his body armor to dig ditches in tropical heat is gaining a mechanical benefit by avoiding increased fatigue accrual, so he shouldn’t receive an SP.
 Conversely, a character who refuses to wear a helmet at any time because it rumples his perfect hair is putting himself at additional risk, so he may deserve an SP.
 npcs and sps Standard NPCs (see p. 311) do not begin with SPs and cannot earn them.
 Each star NPC (see p. 314) begins with the maximum amount of SPs allowed for his age.
The GM may spend a star NPC’s SPs for any of the same effects that a player may spend his PC’s SPs.
 In addition, the GM may spend a star NPC’s SPs to provide any standard NPC under the star NPC’s direct command with an equivalent benefit.
The star NPC must be present in the scene for the GM to use his SPs in this latter manner.
 A star NPC receives one SP every time a PC in the same scene with him receives one.
